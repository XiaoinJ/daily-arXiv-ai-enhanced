Pessah"], "title": "The impact of magnetic fields during tidal disruption events", "comment": "Submitted to MNRAS, comments are welcome!", "summary": "During a tidal disruption event (TDE) the stream debris inherits the magnetic field of the star. As the stream stretches, the magnetic field evolves and can eventually become dynamically important. We study this effect by means of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and a semi-analytic model of the disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. For stellar magnetic fields stronger than $\\sim 10^4\\,\\rm{G}$, magnetic pressure becomes important in a significant fraction of the mass of the stream, leading to a fast increase in its thickness, an effect that may impact its subsequent evolution. We find that this dynamical effect is associated with a phase of transverse equilibrium between magnetic and tidal forces, which causes the stream width to increase with distance to the black hole as $H \\propto R^{5/4}$. In the unbound tail, this fast expansion could enhance the radio emission produced by the interaction with the ambient medium, while in the returning stream, it may qualitatively affect the subsequent gas evolution, particularly the gas dynamics and radiative properties of shocks occurring after the stream's return to pericentre. By characterizing the magnetohydrodynamic properties of the stream from disruption to the first return to pericentre, this work provides physically motivated initial conditions for future studies of the later phases of TDEs, accounting for magnetic fields. This will ultimately shed light on the role of magnetic fields in enabling angular momentum transport in the ensuing accretion disk, thereby affecting observable signatures such as X-ray radiation and relativistic outflows."}

We connect several features of the gravitational wave signal from each model to its previously explored explosion dynamics. In particular, the greater accretion onto the PNS of the more compact model is evident in broad-band frequency features with larger amplitude gravitational wave strains and greater gravitational wave energy release when compared to the less compact model. Additionally, the faster contraction rate of the more compact model is reflected in the $\\sim$26% greater slope of the $g$-/$f$-mode feature (gfF) evolution of the gravitational wave signal. This work shows that in principle gravitational wave detection may provide information about interior stellar structure."}

This makes it crucial to deeply understand the behaviour of our analysis pipelines. A counterintuitive feature of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) second data release is that restricting the dataset to the last 10.3 years (DR2new) increases the inferred GWB significance from $\\leq2σ$ for the full 25-year dataset (DR2full) to $\\geq3.5σ$. We investigate whether this behaviour indicates an anomaly or is a possible outcome of the pipeline. Using realistic, DR2-like simulations with varying timespans, we find that the first 10 years contribute little to the GWB evidence due to their limited frequency coverage. This produces substantial overlap between the HD S/N distributions of DR2full and DR2new. Random noise fluctuations therefore yield a higher GWB evidence in DR2new than in DR2full in $15\\%$ of cases. Furthermore, $5\\%$ of simulations match the HD S/N of the real data, indicating that the observed behaviour is consistent with being a $\\sim2σ$ outcome due to noise fluctuations. Regardless of significance, DR2new simulations introduce biases in the GWB parameter estimation due to spectral leakage effects that are ignored in standard analyses and which flatten the inferred spectrum. Including leakage removes these biases, demonstrating the reliability of DR2new when the signal is properly modelled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining EPTA DR2full with long-baseline data from NANOGrav and PPTA, as well as low-frequency data from LOFAR and NenuFAR, significantly enhances GWB evidence and parameter accuracy. Finally, we examine the impact of the observation timespan and find that short-baseline datasets introduce strong amplitude biases and are ineffective at constraining the GWB."}

In this paper, using a data-driven framework based on binned Gaussian processes, we characterize the joint distribution of BBH primary masses, mass ratios, and effective inspiral spins. We identify three distinct subpopulations in the GWTC-4 sample of observations and investigate their astrophysical origins. We find that only one of the three subpopulations exhibits the $35M_{\\odot}$ peak, which is characterized by a strong preference for equal mass systems and isotropic spin orientations. Our inferred distributions are consistent with a predominantly dynamical origin of this feature. By comparing with theoretical simulations, we further show that the subpopulation that exhibits the $35M_{\\sun}$ peak can exclusively comprise dynamically assembled systems in globular clusters, specifically if black hole birth spins are in the range~$(0.1-0.2)$, whereas the other two subpopulations require substantial contributions from alternative formation channels. We constrain the \\textit{lower bound} on the merger rate of BBHs in globular clusters to be $0.69^{+0.23}_{-0.33} \\rm{Gpc}^{-3}\\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. We conclude that dynamical formation in globular clusters remains a strong candidate for the origin of this excess near $30-40M_{\\odot}$ and that more data and targeted parametric models are necessary to rigorously establish this interpretation."}

In this construction a Lie group $G$ acts on $V=\\mathfrak{g}^{\\oplus m}$ by the adjoint representation together with a second, adjointly compatible action whose failure to commute defines an adjoint torsion $K(ξ,v)$. This torsion generates a canonical quadratic curvature operator on $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ that survives reduction and yields a metric double--bracket term. For $G=SU(n)$ the reduced Euler--Poincar'e equation reproduces exactly the GKSL generator: the Hamiltonian part arises from the coadjoint action, while the dissipator $-\\tfracγ{2}[L,[L,ρ]]$ appears as the torsion--induced metric component of an ACSP bracket. We prove a characterization theorem showing that any quadratic $SU(n)$--equivariant operator generated by torsion factorizes into a Lindblad double commutator; a uniqueness theorem establishing that, under natural structural assumptions, the only admissible dissipator is the Lindblad form; and an orbit--contraction theorem showing strict contraction toward the commutant of the Lindblad operators. For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ the ACSP geometry yields explicit Bloch equations for representative dissipative channels. We also show that the ACSP bracket fits into a metriplectic and contact--geometric framework in which the Lindblad term is the metric component and the Reeb part of a contact Hamiltonian flow. In this picture, decoherence is a curvature--induced contraction generated by Euler--Poincar'e reduction rather than a phenomenological input."}

However, most MAPF formulations assume a simplified robot model for planning, which overlooks execution-time factors such as kinodynamic constraints, communication latency, and controller variability. This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time. We integrate our framework with two popular MAPF methods, MAPF-LNS and CBS.

We approximate the envelope using circular arc splines, curves that balance geometric flexibility and computational simplicity. Our approach combines two concepts to achieve these benefits.\n  First, we represent a planar domain by its medial axis transform (MAT), which is a geometric graph in Minkowski space $\\mathbb R^{2,1}$ (possibly with degenerate branches). We observe that circular arcs in the Minkowski space correspond to MATs of arc spline domains. Furthermore, as a planar domain evolves over time, each branch of its MAT evolves and forms a surface in the Minkowski space. This allows us to reformulate the problem of envelope computation as a problem of computing cyclographic images of finite sets of curves on these surfaces. We propose and compare two pairs of methods for approximating the curves and boundaries of their cyclographic images. All of these methods result in an arc spline approximation of the envelope of the evolving domain.\n  Second, we exploit the geometric flexibility of circular arcs in both the plane and Minkowski space to achieve a high approximation rate. The computational simplicity ensures the efficient trimming of redundant branches of the generated envelope using a sweep line algorithm with optimal computational complexity."}

In this work, we develop a Bayesian risk-averse MPC framework for stochastic, discrete-time, nonlinear systems that provides theoretical guarantees on the consistency of Bayesian learning and closed-loop stability. First, we study Bayesian learning under the conditionally independent state transitions induced by feedback control and establish explicit conditions for Bayesian consistency on an infinitely countable parameter space. Second, we introduce a general notion of risk-averse asymptotic stability (RAAS), defined via comparison function classes and independent of any specific coherent risk measure or convergence rate, and we derive a risk-averse Lyapunov stability theorem together with MPC-specific stability conditions. Third, building on these foundations, we design a practical Bayesian risk-averse MPC scheme that separates epistemic (parametric) and aleatoric (disturbance) uncertainty: additive disturbances are treated in a risk-neutral fashion, while parametric uncertainty is managed via dynamically shrinking ambiguity sets constructed from Bayesian credible intervals, approximated online using particle filtering. To enable real-time implementation, we propose both an optimal and a sub-optimal receding-horizon control policy, the latter obtained by warm-starting from the previous solution, and prove that asymptotic RAAS is recovered as the Bayesian estimator becomes consistent."}

The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar, but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\\dot{M}\\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\\odot} \\rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects, and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equation of states.

We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs."}

The proposed method incorporates vorticity stabilization to ensure optimal-order convergence of the velocity error, especially for convection-dominated cases. As a crucial component of the analysis, exact de Rham and finite element complexes provide a framework whose utility includes establishing velocity error estimates independent of the discrete inf-sup constant. As a representative example, Stenberg finite elements demonstrate the framework's validity and offer several computational advantages: pressure robustness, fewer degrees of freedom than classical RT or BDM elements due to vertex continuity, and convergence without requiring the commuting diagram property. Moreover, the proposed methodology is applicable to a class of finite element pairs that violate the commuting diagram property, thereby offering new possibilities for efficient discretizations of incompressible fluid problems, particularly in high Reynolds number regimes."}

As such, observing strategies are adapting, with a current trend focusing on late-time X-ray follow-ups of (optical) TDEs. While these campaigns are so far proving quite successful, the inherent confirmation bias they introduce in our sample could lead the community to hasty, and perhaps erroneous, conclusions. It is thus important to still pursue the search for nuclear transients in other, more agnostic directions. In this work, we focus on the observational aspects of our field, and lay out two different methods that can be deployed in order to reveal new QPE sources. These complementary methods enable the detection of long-term ($\\sim$years) and short term ($\\sim$minutes) transient events, that would have otherwise been missed by the standard detection pipelines. Both of these methods can be used either for data mining in the 25 years worth of XMM-Newton archive, or to trigger real-time follow-ups upon a more recent discovery."}

Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge."}

This facility will be capable of producing proton and heavy-ion beams with energies reaching several GeV, thereby offering a versatile platform for advanced fundamental physics research. Key scientific objectives include exploring physics beyond the Standard Model through the search for novel particles and interactions, testing fundamental symmetries, investigating exotic hadronic states such as di-baryons, pentaquark states and multi-strange hypernuclei, conducting precise measurements of hadron and hypernucleus properties, and probing the phase boundary and critical point of nuclear matter. To facilitate these investigations, we propose the development of a dedicated experimental apparatus at HIAF - the Huizhou Hadron Spectrometer (HHaS). This paper presents the conceptual design of HHaS, comprising a solenoid magnet, a five-dimensional silicon pixel tracker, a Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD) for time-of-flight measurements, and a Cherenkov-scintillation dual-readout electromagnetic calorimeter. The design anticipates an unprecedented event rate of 1-100 MHz, extensive particle acceptance, a track momentum resolution at 1% level, an electromagnetic energy resolution of ~3% @ 1 GeV and multi-particle identification capabilities. Such capabilities position HHaS as a powerful instrument for advancing experimental studies in particle and nuclear physics.

In this paper we study an edge-constrained version of the problem of finding Hamiltonian paths on a point set. We first consider the problem of finding a single plane Hamiltonian path pi with endpoints s, t in S and constraints given by a segment ab, where a, b in S. We consider the following scenarios: (i) ab in pi; (ii) ab not in pi. We characterize those quintuples (S, a, b, s, t) for which pi exists.

We consider the following scenarios: (i) pi_1 and pi_2 share no edges and ab is an edge of pi_1; (ii) pi_1 and pi_2 share no edges and none of them includes ab as an edge; (iii) both pi_1 and pi_2 include ab as an edge and share no other edges.

Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of abelian number fields with $p$-power Galois group. For an elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{Q}$, we study the Mazur-Tate elements over the finite layers of the cyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ and $L$. We show that the vanishing of the $μ$-invariant is preserved in the extension: if the level-$n$ Mazur-Tate element over $K$ has $μ= 0$, then the corresponding element over $L$ also has $μ= 0$. Moreover, the associated $λ$-invariants satisfy an explicit transition formula. This parallels the work of Hachimori-Matsuno on Selmer groups and of Matsuno on $p$-adic $L$-functions. As an application, we obtain an analogue of Kida's formula for the analytic Iwasawa invariants associated to Pollack's signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. Since our results apply to elliptic curves with any reduction type at $p$ under mild hypotheses, including those with additive reduction, we also obtain a Kida-type formula for the $p$-adic $L$-functions constructed by Delbourgo for elliptic curves with unstable additive reduction. In particular, because Mazur-Tate elements approximate $p$-adic $L$-functions in the limit, our results unify all previously known cases of Kida's formula for analytic Iwasawa invariants."}

Here, we systematically assess the impact of various fixed-topology strategies on phylogenetic and phylodynamic parameter estimates across a diverse set of viral datasets. We compare fully Bayesian joint inference with fixed-topology strategies, including conditioning on maximum likelihood trees subsequently dated with LSD or TreeTime. Our analyses show that global parameters of the substitution and site models are largely robust to the fixed-topology assumption, whereas parameters that depend on the temporal structure of the tree, such as molecular clock rates, node ages, and demographic histories, can exhibit substantial biases. We do treat unconstrained Bayesian analyses as the reference, although we recognize that these too are model-based approximations. Nevertheless, our results highlight serious discordance associated with fixing the topology and underscore the need for faster, time-aware methods that simultaneously integrate topology and parameter estimation.

Multi-wavelength data and multi-standards have been adopted to investigate the issue jointly. First, we find that GRBs with both extended emission and X-ray plateau satisfy a three-parameter relation between the luminosity and the end time of X-ray plateaus and the $γ$-ray isotropic energy as $L_X\\varpropto T_a^{-1.13}E_{γ,iso}^{0.74}$, which is consistent with that of normal GRBs. Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs but GRB 211024B have reasonable periods and majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multi-formation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well."}

Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order.

On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $δ\\approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $δ= 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $δ= 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence.

This setting prevents the direct use of the proximal gradient (PG) method and its variants, and has motivated a growing body of research on new PG-type methods and their convergence theory, in particular, global convergence analysis without imposing any explicit or implicit boundedness assumptions on the iterates. Until recently, the first complete analysis of this kind has been established for the PG method and its specific nonmonotone variants, which has since stimulated further exploration along this research direction. In this paper, we consider a general composite optimization model beyond the global Lipschitz gradient continuity setting. We propose a novel problem-parameter-free algorithm that incorporates a carefully designed nonmonotone line search to handle the non-global Lipschitz gradient continuity, together with an extrapolation step to achieve potential acceleration. Despite the added technical challenges introduced by combining extrapolation with nonmonotone line search, we establish a refined convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm under the Kurdyka-Ł ojasiewicz property, without requiring any boundedness assumptions on the iterates. This work thus further advances the theoretical understanding of PG-type methods in the non-global Lipschitz gradient continuity setting. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and highlight the advantages of integrating extrapolation with a nonmonotone line search."}

Traditional broken-FEEC allows for discontinuous discretizations at patch interfaces, preserving the de Rham structure and offering computational benefits.

These operators are explicit, localized, and metric-independent, ensuring $H^1$ and $H(\\text{curl})$ continuity across non-matching interfaces while preserving high-order polynomial moments. This results in broken-FEEC de Rham sequences with accurate strong and weak derivatives, leading to energy-preserving Maxwell solvers that are explicit and virtually free of spurious modes.

While the question of data sufficiency has been studied extensively in the context of trees, it remains largely unexplored for networks. In this work we take a first step in this direction by establishing bounds on the amount of genomic data required to reconstruct binary level-$1$ semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are binary networks in which reticulation events are indicated by directed edges, all other edges are undirected, and cycles are vertex-disjoint. For this class, methods have been developed recently that are statistically consistent. Roughly speaking, such methods are guaranteed to reconstruct the correct network assuming infinitely long genomic sequences. Here we consider the question whether networks from this class can be uniquely and correctly reconstructed from finite sequences. Specifically, we present an inference algorithm that takes as input genetic sequence data, and demonstrate that the sequence length sufficient to reconstruct the correct network with high probability, under the Cavender-Farris-Neyman model of evolution, scales logarithmically, polynomially, or polylogarithmically with the number of taxa, depending on the parameter regime. As part of our contribution, we also present novel inference rules for quartet data in the semi-directed phylogenetic network setting."}

Leveraging mining operations as a flexible load to monetize this `net-metering surplus' presents a viable synergy, but requires a robust site selection methodology. Traditional GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) struggles with subjective weighting and integrating heterogeneous spatial data (areal-level and lattice-level). This thesis develops and implements a Two-Stage Hierarchical Optimization framework to overcome these limitations. Stage 1 (Areal-Level) employs a cost-benefit optimization to determine the optimal number ($K^*$) and combination of regions, maximizing a final adjusted net profit by balancing surplus power revenue against detailed land and non-linear infrastructure costs. Stage 2 (Point-Level) then uses a GIS-based sliding window search within these selected regions, applying topographic (slope $< 6.0^\\circ$) and land-use constraints at a 30m resolution to identify physically constructible `unit sites'. The model identified an optimal configuration of $K^*=3$ regions (Yongin, Damyang, Miryang) yielding a maximum potential net profit of approximately \\$307 million. Crucially, the Stage 2 screening revealed that Yongin, the most profitable region, was also the most physically constrained, 87\\% of sites filtered out. This research contributes a scalable, objective framework for energy infrastructure siting that effectively integrates multi-scale spatial data. It provides a data-driven strategy for policymakers and grid operators (like Korea Electric Power Corporation) to monetize curtailed renewables and enhance grid stability."}

We demonstrate the pinning of an initially moving vortex to the lattice through excitation of lattice vibrations, and show that the efficiency of this process is higher for attractive than for repulsive nucleus-vortex interactions. We explore the unpinning of a vortex under the action of the applied Magnus force, and find that it is influenced by multiple parameters, including the sign of the pinning force, the lattice orientation, composition, temperature, and the energy of pinning to individual nucleus. In lattices with multiple grains, the unpinning transition is triggered inside the grains with weaker pinning, propagates along the vortex (mediated by the excited Kelvin waves) and crosses into grains with stronger pinning. This is likely to effectively decrease the critical force at which vortices unpin and to produce extended regions of unpinned vorticity. Shearing of the crust lattice (e.g., by a starquake) initiates the unpinning of the vortices that are crossing the slip plane. A close encounter of an unpinned vortex with a pinned vortex would cause the latter to unpin, perhaps initiating an unpinning avalanche of many vortices."}

In this work, we develop a TC renormalization (TCR) algorithm adapted to this CFT-based structure, forming a renormalization-group (RG) framework with generalized symmetry. We show that the full FP tensor can emerge from the RG flow starting with only the three-point function of the primary fields. Remarkably, even when starting solely from topological data, the RG process can still reconstruct the full FP tensor--a method we call as topological bootstrap. This approach deepens the connection between the topological and dynamical aspects of CFT and suggests pathways toward a fully algebraic description of gapless quantum states, with potential extensions to higher dimensions."}

Very recently, the quasicrystal (QC) was proposed as a possible platform to realize AM. However, the existence of AM in QCs still lacks vigorous evidence. In this work, we adopt the sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithm to investigate the magnetic phases in the half-filled Hubbard models in various 2D bipartite QCs, and always obtain Néel ordered states. While the Néel states in bipartite crystals are usually antiferromagnetism (AFM), we find it common that those in bipartite QCs can also be AM or ferromagnetism (FM). Based on symmetry analysis, combined with our comprehensive PQMC results, we propose a general criterion for determining the magnetism classes of the Néel states in a bipartite QC: According to whether the two sublattices are related by the inversion, the other point-group operation, or no operation about the unique symmetry center in the QC, the corresponding Néel state is AFM, AM or FM, respectively. For example, our results yield AM for the two $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QCs and FM for the $D_5$-symmetric Penrose QC at half-filling. Our results provide a solid foundation for experimental investigations and potential applications of different classes of magnetism in QCs."}

This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance."}

However, to investigate neutron star mergers, priors are often chosen in an agnostic way, leaving valuable information from nuclear physics and independent observations of neutron stars unused. In this work, we propose to encode information on neutron star physics into data-driven prior distributions constructed with normalizing flows, referred to as neural priors. These priors take input from constraints on the nuclear equation of state and neutron star population models. Applied to GW170817, GW190425, and GW230529, we highlight two contributions of the framework. First, we demonstrate its ability to provide source classification and to enable model selection of equation of state constraints for loud signals such as GW170817, directly from the gravitational-wave data. Second, we obtain narrower constraints on the source properties through these informed priors. As a result, the neural priors consistently recover higher luminosity distances compared to agnostic priors.

The MCE data exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, in which the sample temperature increases during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. In Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the MCE further displays a striking plateau as a function of time, followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field, across pulses with differing peak-field strengths. Our magnetization measurements reveal an inferred temperature of the magnetic subsystem that differs significantly from the directly measured sample temperature and exhibits opposite hysteresis: the temperature is higher on the up-sweep than the down-sweep, unlike the direct measurements. These observations indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom on the timescale of the pulse ($\\sim 10^{-1}$s). We interpret the results using a phenomenological model involving two thermally coupled subsystems - the magnetic ions and phonons, and a thermal reservoir, which accounts well for the behavior of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.

Traditional deterministic response planning models fail to represent key uncertainties, including variable spill magnitudes, changing environmental sensitivity, and infrastructure limitations. This study develops a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming framework that jointly optimizes the location of oil spill response stations and the allocation of heterogeneous resources across multiple probabilistic spill scenarios. The model integrates a weighted objective that combines spill volume, environmental sensitivity index (ESI), response time, and costs for station setup, deployment, and inter station transfer. Separate importance weights for coverage and cost, together with internal ecological weights, allow decision makers to balance ecological protection and operational efficiency. Data was compiled from Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation spill records and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ESI layers and are converted into model ready scenarios through harmonization and sampling. The model is solved with the Gurobi optimizer, and sensitivity analysis is performed over 324 combinations of importance and ecological weights. Results show about a 35.45% percent improvement in response effectiveness over deterministic methods, as confirmed by the value of the stochastic solution, and reveal clear tradeoffs between cost and ecological coverage. The framework provides a data driven decision support tool for Arctic emergency planners that simultaneously accounts for uncertainty, environmental sensitivity, and realistic logistical constraints."}

Comput., 2011] for the single-species BGK model and is here extended to the multi-species ES-BGK setting. The resulting method is fully explicit, uniformly stable with respect to the Knudsen number and, in the fluid regime, it reduces to a consistent and high-order accurate solver for the limiting macroscopic equations of the mixture. The IMEX structure removes the stiffness associated with the relaxation term so that the time step is constrained only by a hyperbolic CFL condition. The full solver couples a high-order space and velocity discretization that includes third-order time integration, a CWENO3 finite-volume reconstruction in space, exact conservation of macroscopic moments in the discrete velocity space, and a multithreaded implementation.

We adopt a systematic approach which is the so-called $Ω$-expansion. When the stochastic factor is integrated, it is shown that the population size for each strategy fluctuates around the interior equilibrium of the macroscopic equations (corresponding to the deterministic model of the eco-evolutionary game) and its variance converges to a constant that is proportional to the environmental carrying capacity if the interior equilibrium is asymptotically stable. The simulation results demonstrate that the $Ω$ expansion provides a valid approximation, and the reliability of the aforementioned conclusions is verified. Therefore, analogous to Fudenberg and Harris' s stochastic replicator dynamics for infinite populations under external noise (\\emph{J. Econ.

Our DP model uses only the target season's incidence time series and estimates only two parameters, reducing noise and computational burden. A Bayesian extension quantifies the case reporting and fitting uncertainty to produce calibrated predictive intervals. We evaluated the performance of the DP model in the 2022-2023 outbreaks in Florida, where standardized clinical tests and reporting support accurate case determination. The DP framework demonstrates competitive predictive performance at substantially lower computational cost than more elaborate models, making it suitable for dengue early detection where dense surveillance or long historical records are unavailable."}

Apart from that, some of the objects were found to be unassociated with any other classes, and no information is available in other wavebands. These types of objects are classified as unassociated objects in the Fermi catalog. To classify the unassociated objects into known categories and BCUs into a known type of blazar, numerous efforts have been made using the machine learning approach. The ideal way of classification would be to have multi-wavelength temporal and spectral information, which is nearly impossible to have for this number of objects in the near future. In this paper, we focus on classifying BCUs into other types of blazars, such as FSRQs and BL Lacs. For this purpose, we have developed for the first time a deep feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify them, using multi-wavelength data. The complete understanding of blazars can only be known through multi-wavelength observation, and hence, we begin with four input parameters that cover broadband information (radio, optical, X-ray fluxes, and redshift) to train the neural network, and then extend the framework by including additional parameters to examine their impact on the outcome."}

In this work, we develop a TC renormalization (TCR) algorithm adapted to this CFT-based structure, forming a renormalization-group (RG) framework with generalized symmetry.

We explore the biological basis of hand synergies and human gesture analysis, translating joint-level coordination and structural attributes into a modular finger architecture.

While many advanced optimization techniques can be applied in a BD framework, one central technique has not been applied systematically in BD: symmetry handling. The main reason for this is that Benders cuts are not known explicitly but only generated via a separation oracle.\n  In this work, we close this gap by developing a theory of symmetry detection within the BD framework. To this end, we introduce a tailored family of graphs that capture the symmetry information of both the Benders master problem and the Benders oracles. Once symmetries of these graphs are known, which can be found by established techniques, classical symmetry handling approaches become available to accelerate BD. We complement these approaches by devising techniques for the separation and aggregation of symmetric Benders cuts by means of tailored separation routines and extended formulations. Both substantially reduce the number of executions of the separation oracles. In a numerical study, we show the effect of both symmetry handling and cut aggregation for bin packing and scheduling problems."}

To this end, a crucial step is the extension of the notion of an approximating class of sequences (a.c.s.) to the case of matrix sequences with quaternion entries, since it allows us to decompose the difference between a matrix and its preconditioner into low-norm plus (relatively) low-rank terms. As a specific example, we consider classes of quaternion block multilevel circulant matrix sequences as an a.c.s. for quaternion block multilevel Toeplitz matrix sequences. These approximation results lay the foundations for fast preconditioning methods when dealing with large quaternion linear systems stemming from modern applications.

This can be applied to aquatic animals moving in water or terrestrial animals moving in a restricted zone delimited by fences or natural barriers. We demonstrate that the incorporation of these spatial constraints into the latent movement model improves the accuracy of filtering for noisy observations of the positions. We implement an Extended Kalman Filter as well as a particle filter adapted to non-Gaussian error distributions. Our filters are based on solving the SDE through splitting schemes to approximate the latent dynamic."}

Turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM), which may be induced by AGN activity or pre-existing motions, has been proposed as a potential heating mechanism based on analysis of Chandra X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. However, subsequent simulation results have found the subdominant role of turbulence in heating the ICM. To investigate this discrepancy, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster including both AGN feedback and pre-existing turbulence, which is stirred to the observationally constrained level in the Perseus cluster. Our results indicate that, although the velocity field is dominated by the pre-existing turbulence, AGN heating through bubbles and shocks remains significant. More importantly, analysis of the velocity structure function and the energy power spectrum shows that the turbulent heating rate is smaller than the radiative cooling rate, especially in the cluster core. Our results offer insights relevant for recent XRISM observations and indicate that turbulent heating alone cannot offset radiative cooling in CC clusters."}

We propose a decentralized Bayesian framework that enables a swarm of simple robots to identify the safer of two areas, each characterized by an unknown rate of hazardous events governed by a Poisson process. Robots employ a conjugate prior to gradually predict the times between events and derive confidence estimates to adapt their behavior. Our simulation results show that the robot swarm consistently chooses the correct area while reducing exposure to hazardous events by being sample-efficient. Compared to baseline heuristics, our proposed approach shows better performance in terms of safety and speed of convergence. The proposed scenario has potential to extend the current set of benchmarks in collective decision-making and our method has applications in adaptive risk-aware sampling and exploration in hazardous, dynamic environments."}

More precisely, variational approaches apply to the study of Bellman equation as a parabolic quasi-linear equation, when the nonlinearity affects only the gradient of the solution, and the second order derivative term is linear and not degenerate. This corresponds to a stochastic control problem, where the state equation is a diffusion process. The primary objective of this article is to extend this approach to mean field control theory, as an alternative to the current approach, which considers a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) and Fokker-Planck (FP) equations, since the introduction of the theory by Lasry-Lions (2007). The main novelty lies in that the equation studied here is the HJB equation, neither the HJ-FP system nor the master equation; and our results also provide another perspective for probabilistic approaches; see Chassagneux-Crisan-Delarue (2022), Bensoussan-Wong-Yam-Yuan (2024), Bensoussan-Tai-Yam (2025) and Bensoussan-Huang-Tang-Yam (2025) for instance. Within the scope of the PDE methods, the advantage of this article is to solve a larger class of mean field control problems, with moderate regularity; and this kind of variational methods fairly require few conditions on the regularity of the coefficients."}

It introduces \"evidential states\" to represent the information available for causal inference and shows that routine study operations (restriction, conditioning, and intervention) transform these states in ways that do not commute. Because each operation removes or reorganises information differently, changing their order yields evidential states that support different causal claims. This non-commutativity creates a structural trade-off: the steps that secure precise causal identification also eliminate the heterogeneity required for generalisation. Small model, observational and experimental examples illustrate how familiar failures of transportability arise from this order dependence. The result is a concise structural account of why increasing causal precision necessarily narrows the world to which findings apply."}

The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations.

Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering with Different Topologies (ATC-DT) builds global topological maps represented as graphs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during sequential processing. However, its winner selection mechanism relies on an exhaustive nearest-neighbor search over all existing nodes, leading to scalability limitations as the map grows. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical extension called Multi-Layer ATC (MLATC). MLATC organizes nodes into a hierarchy, enabling the nearest-neighbor search to proceed from coarse to fine resolutions, thereby drastically reducing the number of distance evaluations per query. The number of layers is not fixed in advance. MLATC employs an adaptive layer addition mechanism that automatically deepens the hierarchy when lower layers become saturated, keeping the number of user-defined hyperparameters low. Simulation experiments on synthetic large-scale environments show that MLATC accelerates topological map building compared to the original ATC-DT and exhibits a sublinear, approximately logarithmic scaling of search time with respect to the number of nodes. Experiments on campus-scale real-world LiDAR datasets confirm that MLATC maintains a millisecond-level per-frame runtime and enables real-time global topological map building in large-scale environments, significantly outperforming the original ATC-DT in terms of computational efficiency."}

This allows control by a pressure signal smaller than that within the main channel. Furthermore, similar to transistors in electrical circuits, when combined, the proposed valve can perform a variety of logical operations. The basic type operates as a NOT logic element, which is named the fluidic sheet transistor (FST). By integrating multiple FSTs, logical operations such as positive logic, NAND, and NOR can be performed on a single sheet. This paper describes the operating principle, fabrication method, and characteristics of the FST,followed by a method for configuring logical operations.Moreover, we demonstrate the construction of a latch circuit(self-holding logic circuit) using FST, introducing a prototype of a fluid robot system that combines a tactile tube as a fluidic detector and fluid actuators.

Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering.

(J. Comput. Phys. 443: 110516, 2021) and design a fifth-order hybrid fast sweeping scheme for solving steady state problems of hyperbolic conservation laws. Unlike many other fast sweeping methods, the explicit property of fixed-point fast sweeping methods provides flexibility to apply the alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (AWENO) scheme with unequal-sized substencils as the local solver, which facilitates the usage of arbitrary monotone numerical fluxes. Furthermore, a novel hybrid technique is designed in the local solver to combine the nonlinear AWENO interpolation with the linear scheme for an additional improvement in efficiency of the high-order fast sweeping iterations. Numerical examples show that the developed fixed-point fast sweeping hybrid AWENO method with unequal-sized substencils can achieve absolute convergence (i.e., the residue of the fast sweeping iterations converges to machine zero / round off errors) more easily than the original AWENO method with equal-sized substencils, and is more efficient than the popular third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta time-marching approach to converge to steady state solutions."}

But for such complex systems, estimating the magnitude of events which are both non-linear and rare is extremely challenging, and involves considerable computational cost to capture the high-fidelity physics. To address this challenge, we offer a new multi-fidelity screening method, Probabilistic Adaptive Screening (PAS), which accurately predicts extreme values of strongly non-linear wave-induced loads while minimising the required high-fidelity simulation duration. The method introduces a probabilistic approach to multi-fidelity screening, allowing efficient linear potential flow indicators to be used in the low-fidelity stage, even for strongly non-linear load cases. The method is validated against a range of cases, including non-linear waves, and ship vertical bending moments, green water impact loads, and slamming loads. It can be concluded that PAS accurately estimates both the short-term distributions and extreme values in all test cases, with most probable maximum (MPM) values within 10\\% of the available full brute-force Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) results. In addition, PAS achieves this performance very efficiently, requiring less than 4\\% of the high-fidelity simulation time needed for conventional MCS. These results demonstrate that PAS can reliably reproduce the statistics of both weakly and strongly non-linear extreme load problems, while significantly reducing the associated computational cost. The present study validates the statistical PAS framework; further work should focus on validating the full procedure including CFD load simulations, and on validating it for long-term extremes."}

To address this challenge, we have developed a noise removal system by using the deep prior-based method and integrated it into the micro focused SX-ARPES (μSX-ARPES) system at BL25SU in SPring-8. Our implemented system effectively eliminates the grid and spike noise typically present in ARPES data acquired using the voltage Fixed-mode, within about 30 seconds.

A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning.

The governing PDE system goes back to pioneering work of Godunov, Romenski, Peshkov and collaborators. Previous structure-preserving discretizations of this system allowed to respect the curl-free properties of the distortion field and the specific thermal impulse in the absence of source terms and were consistent with the low Mach number limit with respect to the adiabatic sound speed. However, the evolution of the thermal impulse and the distortion field were still discretized explicitly, thus requiring a rather severe CFL stability restriction on the time step based on the shear sound speed and the finite, but potentially large, speed of heat waves. Instead, the new four-split semi-implicit scheme presented in this paper has a material time step restriction only. For this purpose, the governing PDE system is split into four subsystems: i) a convective subsystem, which is the only one that is treated explicitly; ii) a heat subsystem, iii) a subsystem containing momentum, distortion field and specific thermal impulse; iv) a pressure subsystem. The three subsystems ii)-iv) are all discretized implicitly, hence a rather mild CFL restriction based on the velocity of the continuum is imposed. The method is asymptotically consistent with the low Mach number limit and the stiff relaxation limits. Moreover, it maintains an exactly curl-free distortion field and thermal impulse in the case of linear source terms or in their absence. The scheme is benchmarked against classical test cases verifying its theoretical properties."}

However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions. Evaluated in three real world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than SoTA baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world deployment."}

Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets."}

We observe a sharp, highly localized in-gap feature that cannot be explained by conventional band-theory.

Derived from the 3-D incompressible magnetohydrodynamic system, the shallow nature of these applications motivates depth-averaging of both the velocities and magnetic fields. This is advantageous in terms of computational efficiency -- but at the loss of vertical information, thus limiting the predictive power of the MRSW model. To overcome this problem, we employ higher-order vertical moments, but now in the context of conductive fluids. In doing so, the new approximation maintains non-constant vertical profiles of both the horizontal magnetic fields and horizontal velocities, while still remaining in the simplified 2-D framework corresponding to depth integration. In this work, we extend the derivation of the shallow water moment equations to derive the MRSW moment system of arbitrary order; i.e., we represent the vertical profiles of the velocities -- and now additionally the magnetic fields -- by arbitrary-order polynomial expansions, and close the new expanded 2-D system with evolution equations for these polynomial coefficients, found via Galerkin projection.

We attribute this variability to the mixed-quality nature of human demonstrations, where the implicit principles that govern how actions should be carried out are only partially satisfied. To address this challenge, we introduce the LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit criteria for evaluating execution quality. Using these criteria, we develop a decoupled refinement framework that improves execution quality without modifying or retraining the base VLA policy. We formalize Elegant Execution as the satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints (ITCs) and train an Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning to estimate the expected quality of candidate actions. At inference time, a Just-in-Time Intervention (JITI) mechanism monitors critic confidence and intervenes only at decision-critical moments, providing selective, on-demand refinement. Experiments on LIBERO-Elegant and real-world manipulation tasks show that the learned Elegance Critic substantially improves execution quality, even on unseen tasks.

Both networks share a unified physics residual while being softly specialized via distance-weighted priors ($w_{\\text{bd}} = \\exp(-d/τ)$) that are cosine-annealed during training.

Training proceeds in two phases: Phase~1 uses uniform collocation to establish network roles and stabilize boundary satisfaction; Phase~2 employs focused sampling (e.g. ring sampling near $\\partialΩ$) with annealed role weights to efficiently resolve localized features. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks, including the 1D Fokker-Planck equation, the Laplace equation, the Poisson equation, and the 1D wave equation.

We propose a hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates RL-based reactive navigation with on-demand Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) to explicitly resolve topological deadlocks.

Existing fine-tuning methods lack specificity, adapting the same set of parameters regardless of a task's visual, linguistic, and physical characteristics. Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task. In this work, we introduce Robotic Steering, a finetuning approach grounded in mechanistic interpretability that leverages few-shot demonstrations to identify and selectively finetune task-specific attention heads aligned with the physical, visual, and linguistic requirements of robotic tasks.

But if the Hessian of the objective function has a nontrivial kernel at the critical point, then these results are inconclusive. In this paper, we show how relevant information can be extracted by ``blowing up'' the objective function around the non-strict saddle point, i.e., by a suitable nonlinear rescaling that makes the higher order geometry visible.

Yet, these methods mostly rely on egocentric (first-person) perception, limiting their performance, especially when the viewpoint of the robot is occluded. A promising solution would be to enhance the robot's environmental awareness by using complementary viewpoints, such as multiple actors exchanging perceptual information. Inspired by this idea, this work proposes a multi-view depth-based locomotion framework that combines egocentric and exocentric observations to provide richer environmental context during agile locomotion. Using a teacher-student distillation approach, the student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams while remaining robust to real-world sensing imperfections. To further improve robustness, we introduce extensive domain randomization, including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations that emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing. Simulation results show that multi-viewpoints policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers, while maintaining stability when the exocentric camera is partially or completely unavailable. Additional experiments show that moderate viewpoint misalignment is well tolerated when incorporated during training. This study demonstrates that heterogeneous visual feedback improves robustness and agility in quadrupedal locomotion.

However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments."}

By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.\n  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes.

Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence.

The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using a constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm that jointly optimizes trajectory smoothness, control effort, and risk exposure while maintaining strict feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of safety and efficiency, achieving collision-free trajectories with shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s) while maintaining smooth and comfortable acceleration patterns. In dense roundabout environments the planner further demonstrates robust adaptability, producing larger safety margins, lower jerk, and superior curvature smoothness compared with APF, MPC, and RRT based baselines.

Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets. These results demonstrate that our principled aleatoric uncertainty modeling combined with driving priors significantly advances the safety and reliability of camera-only E2E autonomous driving."}

One critical but understudied aspect is the \\textbf{potential risk} situations, where the risk is \\textbf{not yet observable} but can be inferred from subtle precursors, such as anomalous behaviors or commonsense violations. Recognizing these precursors requires strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, which are often absent in current AV systems due to the scarcity of such cases in existing driving or risk-centric datasets. Moreover, current autonomous driving accident datasets often lack annotations of the causal reasoning chains behind incidents, which are essential for identifying potential risks before they become observable. To address these gaps, we introduce PotentialRiskQA, a novel vision-language dataset designed for reasoning about potential risks prior to observation. Each sample is annotated with structured scene descriptions, semantic precursors, and inferred risk outcomes. Based on this dataset, we further propose PR-Reasoner, a vision-language-model-based framework tailored for onboard potential risk reasoning. Experimental results show that fine-tuning on PotentialRiskQA enables PR-Reasoner to significantly enhance its performance on the potential risk reasoning task compared to baseline VLMs. Together, our dataset and model provide a foundation for developing autonomous systems with improved foresight and proactive safety capabilities, moving toward more intelligent and resilient AVs."}

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate."}

We present DiskChunGS, a scalable 3DGS SLAM system that overcomes this bottleneck through an out-of-core approach that partitions scenes into spatial chunks and maintains only active regions in GPU memory while storing inactive areas on disk. Our architecture integrates seamlessly with existing SLAM frameworks for pose estimation and loop closure, enabling globally consistent reconstruction at scale. We validate DiskChunGS on indoor scenes (Replica, TUM-RGBD), urban driving scenarios (KITTI), and resource-constrained Nvidia Jetson platforms.

Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. Notably, with only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot, our approach successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability in robotic manipulation."}

We devise a novel multi-step reasoning process based on obstruction paths originated by the target object.

However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns."}

Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of \"visible\" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA."}

Egocentric frames are processed by a structured VLM prompt, embedded and matched against a curated database of validated scenarios, and mapped to joint-level impedance commands via inverse kinematics. We evaluate the system on tabletop manipulation tasks with and without human presence, including wiping, object handovers, and liquid pouring.

Integrating bio-inspired design principles into linear actuators could bring forth the next generation of adaptive and energy efficient smart material-based actuation systems. The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment. The study introduces SMA coil-based actuator as an advanced design that can be deployed for high force-high stroke applications.

Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts."}
