We are interested in two constrained drawing problems where the input specifies a so-called representation, that is: a planar embedding; the angles occurring between adjacent edges; the bends along each edge. In Orthogonal Realizability one is asked to compute any orthogonal drawing satisfying the constraints, while in Orthogonal Compaction the goal is to find such a drawing using minimum area. While Orthogonal Realizability can be solved in linear time, Orthogonal Compaction is NP-hard even if the graph is a cycle. In contrast, already Octilinear Realizability is known to be NP-hard. In this paper we investigate Octilinear Realizability and Octilinear Compaction problems. We prove that Octilinear Realizability remains NP-hard if at most one face is not convex or if each interior face has at most 8 reflex corners. We also strengthen the hardness proof of Octilinear Compaction, showing that Octilinear Compaction does not admit a PTAS even if the representation has no reflex corner except at most 4 incident to the external face. On the positive side, we prove that Octilinear Realizability is FPT in the number of reflex corners and for Octilinear Compaction we describe an XP algorithm on the number of edges represented with a +1 or -1 slope segment (i.e., the diagonals), again for the case where the representation has no reflex corner except at most 4 incident to the external face."}

Furthermore, due to the existence of a single collective mode associated with the order parameter in the uniform paired phase, in the weak-coupling regime, the $p$-wave paired state, in general (for example, in the superconducting state of electrons), may be prone to a PDW instability."}

Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models."}

Screening by a single additive ACE score (e.g., a $\\ge 4$ cutoff) has poor individual-level discrimination. We instead identify replicable combinations of ACEs that elevate adult depression risk. Our data turnover framework enables a single research team to explore, confirm, and replicate within one observational dataset while controlling the family-wise error rate. We integrate isotonic subgroup selection (ISS) to estimate a higher-risk subgroup under a monotonicity assumption- additional ACE exposure or higher intensity cannot reduce depression risk. We pre-specify a risk threshold $τ$ corresponding to roughly a two-fold increase in the odds of depression relative to the no-ACE baseline. Within data turnover, the prespecified component improves power while maintaining FWER control, as demonstrated in simulations. Guided by EDA, we adopt frequency coding for ACE items, retaining intensity information that reduces false positives relative to binary or score codings. The result is a replicable, pattern-based higher-risk subgroup. On held-out BRFSS 2022, we show that, at the same level of specificity (0.95), using our replicable subgroup as the screening rule increases sensitivity by 26\\% compared with an ACE-score cutoff, yielding concrete triggers that are straightforward to implement and help target scarce clinical screening resources toward truly higher-risk profiles."}

We are able to prove persistence and extinction results even in the setting when the dispersal rates are stochastic. As applications we look at Beverton-Holt and Hassell functional responses. We find explicit approximations for the total population size at stationarity when we look at slow and fast dispersal. In particular, we show that if dispersal is small then in the Beverton-Holt setting, if the carrying capacity is random, then environmental fluctuations are always detrimental and decrease the total population size. Instead, in the Hassell setting, if the inverse of the carrying capacity is made random, then environmental fluctuations always increase the population size. Fast dispersal can save populations from extinction and therefore increase the total population size. We also analyze a different type of environmental fluctuation which comes from switching environmental states according to a Markov chain and find explicit approximations when the switching is either fast or slow - in examples we are able to show that slow switching leads to a higher population size than fast switching.\n  Using and modifying some approximation results due to Cuello, we find expressions for the total population size in the $n=2$ patch setting when the growth rates, carrying capacities, and dispersal rates are influenced by random fluctuations. We find that there is a complicated interaction between the various terms and that the covariances between the various random parameters (growth rate, carrying capacity, dispersal rate) play a key role in whether we get an increase or a decrease in the total population size. Environmental fluctuations turn to sometimes be beneficial -- this show that not only dispersal, but also environmental stochasticity can lead to an increase in population size."}

We find that the X-ray spectra are predominantly thermal and can be described by low-absorbed blackbody models with effective temperatures ranging from 50 to 210 eV. In two sources, the spectra also show narrow absorption features at $300 - 400$ eV. Additional non-thermal emission components are not detected in any of the five candidates. The soft X-ray emission, the absence of optical counterparts in four sources, and the consequent large X-ray-to-optical flux ratios $>3000 - 5400$ confirm their INS nature. For the remaining source, eRASSU J144516.0-374428, the available data do not allow a confident exclusion of an active galactic nucleus nature. However, if the source is Galactic, the small inferred X-ray emitting region is reminiscent of a heated pulsar polar cap, possibly pointing to a binary pulsar nature. X-ray timing searches do not detect significant modulations in all candidates, implying pulsed fraction upper limits of 13 - 19% ($0.001-13.5$ Hz). The absence of pulsations in the FAST observations targeting eRASSU J081952.1-131930 and eRASSU J084046.2-115222 excludes periodic magnetospheric emission at 1 - 1.5 GHz with an $8σ$ significance down to 4.08 $μ$Jy and 2.72 $μ$Jy, respectively. The long-term X-ray emission of all sources does not imply significant variability. Additional observations are warranted to establish exact neutron star types. At the same time, the confirmation of the predominantly thermal neutron star nature in four additional sources highlights the power of SRG/eROSITA to complement the Galactic INS population."}

We provide a complete characterization of all such methods in the convex optimization setting and prove that this characterization is sharp: unconditional convergence holds exactly on the identified parameter regions.

Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry.

Because producing runs determines game outcomes, RBI has long served as a central statistic in evaluating offensive performance. However, traditional RBI treats all batted-in runs equally and ignores th game context in which they occur, such as leverage, score state, and the actual impact of a run on a team's chance of winning. In this paper, we introduce two new context-aware metrics-Adjusted RBI (ARBI) and Contextual RBI (CRBI)-that address the fundamental limitations of RBI by incorporating Win Expectancy (WE). ARBI rescales each RBI according to the change in WE before and after the scoring event, assigning more value to runs that meaningfully shift the likelihood of winning and less to runs scored in low-leverage situations. We then extend this framework to CRBI, which further differentiates RBIs with the same WE change by accounting for the terminal WE at the end of the event. This refinement captures the idea that an RBI increasing WE from, for example, 0.45 to 0.65 has a larger competitive impact than one increasing WE from 0.05 to 0.25, even though both represent a 20% increase. Together, ARBI and CRBI provide calibrated, context-sensitive measures of offensive contribution that more accurately reflect the true value of run production. These metrics modernize the interpretation of RBI and have broad applications in player evaluation, forecasting, contract evaluation, and decision-making in baseball analytics."}

Building on our previously developed Extended Multistage Clonal Expansion Tumor (MSCE-T) model, we perform a theoretical analysis to determine the conditions under which Clemmesen's hook would occur. Our results show that Clemmesen's hook can be quantitatively explained by time-specific changes in the proliferative and apoptotic balance of early-stage mutated cell populations, corresponding to the decline in progesterone levels and progesterone-driven proliferation due to reduced menstrual cycles preceding menopause, and changing dominant carcinogenic impact from alternative growth pathways post-menopause (e.g., adipose-derived growth signals). In contrast, variation in last-stage clonal dynamics cannot effectively reproduce the observed non-monotonic incidence pattern. Analytical results further demonstrate that midlife incidence dynamics corresponding to the hook are governed primarily by intrinsic proliferative processes rather than detection effects. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic and mathematical explanation for Clemmesen's hook and establishes a quantitative framework linking hormonal transitions during menopause to age-specific breast cancer incidence curve."}

Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets pointed close to our line of sight, offer a unique view into jet dynamics. Blazar $γ$-ray light curves exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flares that point to promising alternative dissipation mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection. This study uses three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) and resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations with the PLUTO code to explore magnetic reconnection in turbulent, magnetized plasma columns. Focusing on current-driven kink instabilities, we identify the formation of current sheets due to magnetic reconnection, leading to plasmoid formation. We develop a novel technique combining hierarchical structure analysis and reconnection diagnostics to identify reconnecting current sheets. A statistical analysis of their geometry and orientation reveals a smaller subset that aligns closely with the jet axis, consistent with the jet-in-jet model. These structures can generate relativistically moving plasmoids with significant Doppler boosting, offering a plausible mechanism for the fast flares superimposed on slowly varying blazar light curves. These findings provide new insights into the plasma dynamics of relativistic jets and strengthen the case for magnetic reconnection as a key mechanism in blazar $γ$-ray variability."}

His approach was inspired by Weyl's proof of the character formula for irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. Hecht, Miličić, Schmid and Wolf gave an alternative construction using the localization theory of Beilinson and Bernstein: the discrete series are the global sections of standard Harish-Chandra sheaves on the flag variety attached to the closed orbits of the complexification of a maximal compact subgroup. Their approach was inspired by the Borel-Weil theorem. In this paper, we give an explicit correspondence between these parametrizations. First, for a nilpotent radical $\\mathfrak{n}$ of any Borel subalgebra, we establish a geometric formula for the $\\mathfrak{n}$-homology of a module over the universal enveloping algebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, in terms of its localization on the flag variety of $\\mathfrak{g}$.

Using Osborne's formula, this gives the formula for the character on the elliptic set, and leads to the matching of Harish-Chandra's parameters for discrete series representations with the geometric parameters.

The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

The identity operator, for example, can be reconstructed using a basis of harmonic oscillator states leading to a narrow peak approximation of the $δ$ function, but this peak may be perturbed by small, residual, oscillations. The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-δ''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators."}

The method is derived from a continuous-time dynamical system whose vector field is obtained by solving a convex QCQP that enforces monotonic descent of the objective and forward invariance of the feasible set. The resulting continuous-time dynamics achieve an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate to first-order stationary points under standard constraint qualification conditions. We then propose a safeguarded Euler discretization with adaptive step-size selection that preserves this convergence rate while maintaining both descent and feasibility in discrete time. To enhance scalability, we develop an active-set variant (SS-QCQP-AS) that selectively enforces constraints near the boundary, substantially reducing computational cost without compromising theoretical guarantees. Numerical experiments on a multi-agent nonlinear optimal control problem demonstrate that SS-QCQP and SS-QCQP-AS maintain feasibility, exhibit the predicted convergence behavior, and deliver solution quality comparable to second-order solvers such as SQP and IPOPT."}

Motivated by childhood vaccine monitoring programs in rural areas of Chad and Niger, we conducted a simulation study to evaluate calibration-weighted design-based and logistic regression-based imputation estimators of the finite-population proportion of MCV1 coverage. These estimators use a hybrid approach that anchors non-probabilistic follow-up survey to probabilistic baseline census to account for selection bias. We explored varying degrees of non-ignorable selection bias (odds ratios from 1.0-1.5), percentage of villages sampled (25-75%), and village-level survey response rate to the follow-up survey (50-80%). Our performance metrics included bias, coverage, and proportion of simulated 95% confidence intervals falling within equivalence margins of 5% and 7.5% (equivalence tolerance). For both adjustment methods, the performance worsened with higher selection bias and lower response rate and generally improved as a larger proportion of villages was sampled. Under the worst scenario with 1.5 OR, 25% village sampled, and 50% survey response rate, both methods showed empirical biases of 2.1% or less, below 95% coverage, and low equivalence tolerances. In more realistic scenarios, the performance of our estimators showed lower biases and close to 95% coverage. For example, at OR$\\leq$1.2, both methods showed high performance, except at the lowest village sampling and participation rates.

Here we report observational evidence that the radio jet and the very high-energy (VHE) and ultra high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray emission could be aligned along a common axis, indicating a co-spatial or co-directional origin. This alignment supports a model where synchrotron radio emission, VHE and UHE gamma rays are produced within a single, highly collimated relativistic outflow.

This case highlights the potential of V4641 Sgr as a PeVatron candidate within our Galaxy and provides a benchmark for understanding jet composition and magnetic structure in microquasars."}

We establish key analytical properties of the value function and characterise the optimal capital-injection strategy through an explicit threshold. We also show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the associated HJB variational inequality. For numerical purposes, we first compute a benchmark solution via a monotone finite-difference scheme with Howard's policy iteration. We then develop a reinforcement learning approach based on policy-gradient and actor-critic methods. The learned strategies closely match the PDE benchmark and remain stable across initial conditions. The results highlight the relevance of policy-gradient techniques for dividend optimisation under self-exciting claim dynamics and point toward scalable methods for higher-dimensional extensions."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "A Toda prime of an integer $n$ is an odd prime $p$ such that $4n=(p-1)k$ with $k$ coprime to $p$. We conjecture that every positive integer admits at least two Toda primes. We give a partial proof that every positive integer admits at least one Toda prime. We conclude by discussing connections to denominators of Bernoulli numbers and a generalization of Sophie Germain primes."}

Chung", "Patrick Ciarlet", "Xingguang Jin", "Changqing Ye"], "title": "Multiscale Methods for wave propagation in materials with sign-changing coefficients", "comment": null, "summary": "From a mathematical perspective, the extraordinary properties of metamaterials are often reflected in the coefficients of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs). These coefficients may fall outside the assumptions of classical theory, particularly when the effective dielectric permittivity and/or magnetic permeability are negative. This situation can transform a coercive operator into a non-coercive one, potentially leading to ill-posedness. In this paper, we utilize the Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM), specifically designed for time-harmonic electromagnetic wave problems, where the construction of auxiliary spaces in the original CEM-GMsFEM is tailored to accommodate the sign-changing setting. Based on the framework of \\texttt{T}-coercivity theory and resolution conditions, we establish the inf-sup stability and provide an a priori error estimate for the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in handling such sophisticated coefficient profiles."}

While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models."}

Empirical evidence suggests that both the marginal and dependence structures for extreme precipitation in the area exhibit seasonal patterns, and spatial dependence appears to weaken as events become more extreme. We investigate factors affecting the marginal distributions, the spatial dependence and the interplay between them. Capturing these features is essential to provide a realistic description of extreme precipitation processes in order to better estimate their associated risks. With this aim, we identify various climatic covariates at different spatio-temporal scales and explore their usefulness. We go beyond existing literature by investigating and comparing the performance of recently proposed covariate-dependent models for both the marginal and dependence structures of extremes. Furthermore, a flexible max-id model, which encompasses both asymptotic dependence and independence, is used to learn about the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall processes at extreme levels. We find that modelling non-stationarity only at the marginal level does not fully capture the variability of precipitation extremes, and that it is important to also capture the seasonal variation of extremal dependence."}

This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed."}

Most of the standard vehicles follow the Ackermann style steering mechanism. This has become to de facto standard for large and long faring vehicles. The local planner of an autonomous vehicle controls the low-level vehicle movement upon which the vehicle will perform its motor actuation. In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction. Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance. The root mean square error between the optimal tracking trajectory and the target trajectory was reduced by 27.65% in the simulation results, demonstrating the high robustness and flexibility of the developed controller."}

In this framework, particles and fields are treated simultaneously within a single presymplectic manifold, and the Gotay--Nester--Hinds algorithm recovers the full Maxwell-Vlasov equations as the compatibility conditions of a single variational system. The hierarchy of constraints -- including Vlasov advection, Gauss and Faraday laws, and the electromagnetic gauge structure -- arises naturally from the presymplectic geometry of the SR formalism.\n  Reduction by the diffeomorphism group of phase space produces a reduced presymplectic manifold whose dynamics reproduces both the Euler--Poincare formulation for the Vlasov sector and the Marsden--Weinstein/Morrison--Greene Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. We further extend the construction to equilibria that partially break the relabeling symmetry, obtaining a translated SR system that yields an effective symplectic linearization, clarifies the appearance of Goldstone-type neutral modes, and provides a geometric foundation for the energy--Casimir method.\n  Finally, we incorporate external antenna fields into this setting by introducing affine Hamiltonian controls and establishing a theory of controlled symmetry breaking within the reduced SR framework. This leads to controlled Lie--Poisson equations for plasma--antenna coupling and a geometric mechanism for stabilization through Casimir shaping and symmetry-selective forcing. The resulting picture provides a single presymplectic structure that unifies Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, gauge, reduction, and control-theoretic aspects of the Maxwell-Vlasov system."}

The proposed approach is compared to other multi-fidelity models, and benchmarks for different application cases of increasing complexity are provided."}

In this work, we present targeted radio observations of 31 such candidates using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and the Shanghai TianMa Radio Telescope. Over a total of 46.65 hours of observing time, we detected neither periodic nor single-pulse radio emissions. These nondetections place stringent upper limits on the flux densities of any potential radio signals, reaching ~4 $μ$Jy for periodic emission and ~10 mJy for single pulses with FAST. Since our observations are highly sensitive and the flux density upper limits are well below the median fluxes of known Galactic pulsars, this suggests that geometric beaming is the most likely explanation for the non-detections if these objects are indeed pulsars. Alternatively, the NSs may be sufficiently old ($\\gtrsim$ 10 Gyr) and have become intrinsically radio-quiet. In this case, our findings highlight the inherent difficulty of confirming NSs in such old detached binary systems through radio pulsation searches."}

The coupling preserves the energy conserving structure of the low order dynamics solver, while the high order material transport scheme is provably tracer variance conserving, or damping with the inclusion of upwinding. The two methods are coupled via the multigrid hierarchy of the low order dynamics solver, with the basis functions of the high order transport being collocated at the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points with the low order dynamics on the finest scale multigrid mesh.\n  Standard test cases are presented to verify the consistency and conservation properties of the method.

Existing methods face a trad-off: online planners and controllers lack formal safety guarantees, while offline planners lack adaptability to changes in the number of agents or desired formation. To address this gap, we propose a hybrid architecture where a single leader tracks a pre-computed, safe trajectory, which serves as a shared trajectory backup set for all follower agents. Followers execute a nominal formation-keeping tracking controller, and are guaranteed to remain safe by always possessing a known-safe backup maneuver along the leader's path. We formally prove this method ensures collision avoidance with both static obstacles and other agents. The primary contributions are: (1) the multi-agent gatekeeper algorithm, which extends our single-agent gatekeeper framework to multi-agent systems; (2) the trajectory backup set for provably safe inter-agent coordination for leader-follower formation control; and (3) the first application of the gatekeeper framework in a 3D environment. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated 3D urban environment, where it achieved a 100% collision-avoidance success rate across 100 randomized trials, significantly outperforming baseline CBF and NMPC methods.

Using data on access to Local Anti-Violence Centers in the Apulia region from 2021 to 2024, we investigate the impact of municipality-level socioeconomic characteristics and local vulnerabilities on both the incidence and reporting of gender-based violence. To explicitly account for spatial dependence, we compare four spatial models within the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation framework for Bayesian model estimation. We assess the relative fit of the competing models, discussing their prior assumptions, spatial confounding effects, and inferential implications. Our findings indicate that access to support services decreases with distance from the residential municipality, highlighting spatial constraints in reporting and the strategic importance of support center location. Furthermore, lower education levels appear to contribute to under-reporting in disadvantaged areas, while higher economic development may be associated with a lower incidence of reported violence. This study emphasises the critical role of spatial modelling in capturing reporting dynamics and informing policy interventions."}

Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($α> -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > β> -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $Γ\\sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\\%$-$20\\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $δ\\sim 1.8$.

Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold.

Many existing distributed algorithms rely on solving local subproblems via the $\\operatorname{argmin}$ operator in each iteration. Such approaches become computationally burdensome or intractable when local cost functions are complex. To address this challenge, we propose a novel distributed gradient-based algorithm that avoids solving a local optimization problem at each iteration by leveraging first-order approximations and projection onto local feasible sets. The algorithm operates in a fully distributed manner, requiring only local communication without exchanging gradients or primal variables. We rigorously establish sublinear convergence for general convex cost functions and linear convergence under strong convexity and smoothness conditions. Numerical simulation on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrates the superior computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art distributed optimization algorithms."}

At the same time, certain subquotients of the adeles are direct limits of compact subquotients or inverse limits of discrete subquotients, compatible in a special way. Using this fact, the paper defines a translation invariant measure and integration on certain subquotients of the geometric adeles of surfaces. This theory is considerably different from the theory of integration on analytic adeles of surfaces. After revising aspects of one-dimensional theory, the paper includes a full definition of two-dimensional geometric adeles. A number of their new topological properties are established. The new translation invariant measure and integration on selective subquotients of the geometric adeles is used for integrals of certain functions in a two-dimensional method describing the size of adelic cohomology groups of surfaces, without using standard adelic complexes. A formula for the Euler characteristic of the surface and its divisor in terms of integrals over subquotients of geometric adeles is proved. Using the Euler characteristic, a new two-dimensional adelic intersection number is introduced. For geometric surfaces it is a positive multiple of the standard intersection number. Several results in the previous study of geometric adeles are given new proofs."}

Our method leverages Gaussian process (GP) priors for spatially varying intercept and slope. To improve computational efficiency under a large number of spatial locations, we implemented a Hilbert space low-rank approximation of the GP. We modeled the baseline hazard curves as piecewise constant, and introduced a novel multiplicative gamma process prior to induce shrinkage and smoothing. A loss-based clustering method was then used on the spatial random effects to identify high-risk regions. We demonstrate the utility of this method through simulation and a real-world analysis of EHR data from Duke Hospital to study readmission risk of elderly patients with upper extremity fractures.

In this study, we examine how the data coverage influences the reliability of parameter estimation within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework. Using OJ 287, TXS 0506+056, and Mrk 421 as representative of the low-, intermediate- and high synchrotron peak classes (LSP, ISP and HSP), respectively, we generate synthetic SEDs based on their best-fit models and perform 1,000 fits for each of the 21 observational configurations per source type. Our analysis quantifies the coverage probability for all model parameters, such has the magnetic field strength and the electron luminosity, and reveals that different blazar subclasses exhibit distinct sensitivities to spectral gaps. For LSPs, a minimal dataset comprising optical/UV, X-ray, and GeV $γ$-ray bands is sufficient for robust parameter inference. In contrast, ISPs and HSPs require broader spectral coverage to constrain the physical parameters. For ISP, we find that reliable parameter recovery can be achieved with two different minimal band combinations: \\textit{(i)} X-ray, high energy $γ$-ray, and very high energy $γ$-ray data, or \\textit{(ii)} optical/UV, X-ray, and high energy $γ$-ray data. For HSPs, the minimal configuration enabling reliable parameter recovery includes the optical/UV, X-ray, and very high energy $γ$-ray bands. We discuss the role of very high energy $γ$-ray observations, showing that they significantly enhance parameter recovery for HSPs.

Over the last 50 years, most work on pair correlation of zeta-zeros has continued to assume RH. Here we show that if RH could be removed from Montgomery's simple zero proof, then this would also give a proof that 2/3 of the zeros are on the critical line. While at present we cannot unconditionally obtain this result, we have proved in joint work that this is true if we assume all the zeros are in a narrow enough region centered on the critical line. In separate joint work we use the same idea with a related pair correlation method to prove that assuming the Pair Correlation Conjecture, also without the assumption of RH, we obtain 100\\% of the zeros are simple and on the critical line."}

The method augments continuous piecewise linear velocity spaces with elementwise bubble functions, yielding a locally conservative velocity approximation while retaining the efficiency of low-order continuous elements. The viscous term is discretized using a symmetric interior penalty formulation, and the divergence constraint is imposed through a stable pressure space. To enhance the robustness of the velocity approximation with respect to the pressure, a reconstruction operator is introduced in the convective and coupling terms, resulting in a pressure-robust scheme whose accuracy does not deteriorate for small viscosities. Both Picard and Newton linearizations are formulated in a fully discrete manner, and the corresponding linear systems are assembled efficiently at each iteration. Optimal a~priori error estimates are established for the velocity in the mesh-dependent energy norm and for the pressure in the $L^2$ norm. Two representative numerical experiments are presented: a smooth manufactured solution and the lid-driven cavity flow. The numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates, demonstrating first-order convergence of the velocity in the energy norm, second-order convergence in the $L^2$ norm, and first-order convergence of the pressure. The proposed EG scheme accurately captures characteristic flow structures, illustrating its effectiveness and robustness for incompressible flow simulation."}

Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control.

The quasar 0954+556 at redshift of 0.903 is an intriguing source exhibiting an unusual radio jet structure with significantly different jet directions at kpc and pc scales. At kpc scales, images from the VLA exhibit a bright core, a linear jet extending 24 kpc to the northwest, and a discrete jet component 16 kpc to the northeast. At pc scales, images from the VLBA show a two-component structure with a projected separation of 360 pc in the north-south direction. The peculiar structure of 0954+556 might result from jet reorientation. Here, our aim was to investigate the possible mechanism via multiscale and multifrequency deep radio images. We performed VLA and VLBA observations of 0954+556. Together with some existing data in the NRAO data archive, we made multiple VLA images at 1.4-22 GHz and VLBA images at 1.7-43 GHz for various image analyses of the jet structure. We identified the location of the radio core at pc scales, detected the faint counter-jets at both pc and kpc scales for the first time, and revealed a diffuse emission region connecting pc and kpc scale forward jets. Our spectral index distribution and spectral aging analysis indicate that 0954+556 might undergo at least two episodes of jet activity during the current AGN phase. Moreover, pc scale polarization maps display a well-resolved spine-sheath polarization structure. It seems that the jet direction of 0954+556 changed significantly during intermittent jet activity. This may explain the different jet orientations and spectral ages observed from kpc to pc scales. The research provides a strong case that AGN jet direction might change rapidly on timescales of one million years."}

The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions.

Despite this, still very little is known about their UHE gamma-ray emission, their number in the Galaxy, or their contribution to the gamma-ray emission of our Galaxy. In this work, we propose a self-consistent data-driven model of the UHE gamma-ray emission of PWNe based on the ATNF and LHAASO catalogs. More specifically, we build a model of the UHE gamma-ray emission of PWNe that preserves the statistical relationships in the ATNF catalog and reproduces the number of PWNe detected in the LHAASO catalog. To cope with the limited data available in the LHAASO catalog when performing fits on gamma-ray data, we introduce the concept of censored regression that allows to also use the information provided by unresolved sources. Using our model, we find that reproducing the number of PWNe detected by LHAASO requires either fractions of misaligned pulsars smaller ($\\lesssim60\\%$) than usually found in the literature, or that some of the associations of PWNe to ATNF pulsars made by LHAASO may not be true. In both cases, we find that in order to reach self-consistency between radio and gamma-ray data, it is necessary that the majority of the unidentified sources in the LHAASO catalog are PWNe associated to an unseen pulsar. Moreover, using our model we also find that the contribution of unresolved PWNe to the total (diffuse) gamma-ray background measured by LHAASO in the $1-1000\\,\\rm{TeV}$ range is always smaller than $\\lesssim10\\%$ ($\\lesssim30\\%$).

Highly refined, dynamically adaptive spatial discretization is typically required, leading to prohibitive computational costs. Semi-analytical approaches mitigate this by decomposing the temperature field into an analytical point-source solution and a complementary numerical field that enforces boundary conditions. However, state-of-the-art implementations either necessitate extensive mesh refinement near boundaries or rely on restrictive image source techniques, limiting their efficiency and applicability to complex geometries. This study presents a novel reformulation of the semi-analytical framework using Isogeometric Analysis. The laser heat input is captured by the analytical point-source solution, while the complementary correction field, which imposes boundary conditions, is solved using a spline-based IGA discretization. The governing heat equation for the correction field is cast in a weak form, discretized with NURBS basis functions, and advanced in time using an implicit $θ$-scheme. This approach leverages IGA's key advantages: exact geometry representation, higher-order continuity, and superior accuracy per degree of freedom. These features unlock efficient thermal modeling of realistic parts with complex contours. Our strategy eliminates the need for scan-wise remeshing and robustly handles intricate geometric features like sharp corners and varying cross-sections.

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter.

Through general-relativistic calculations of uniformly rotating sequences, we analyze their mass--radius relations, moments of inertia, quadrupole moments, surface redshifts, Keplerian frequencies, and energy components. A central result of this work is the full decomposition of the stellar energy budget in rotating strange stars, separating gravitational, internal, rotational, and binding energy contributions. Rotation amplifies the intrinsic EOS differences: the MIT model supports more massive ($M_{\\max} \\gtrsim 3.3\\,M_\\odot$) compact stars with larger moments of inertia and greater resistance to deformation, while the DDQM model produces larger radii, less massive stars limited by mass-shedding at lower frequencies. Combined measurements of mass, radius, and frequency can thus break the EOS degeneracy; massive, rapidly rotating pulsars favors MIT-like EOS, whereas larger radii in canonical stars point to a DDQM-like model. These rotational observables, soon to be tightly constrained by NICER and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, offer a means to test the existence and composition of self-bound quark matter in compact stars."}

Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods."}

From the inferred redshift of the absorption line, the compactness of the neutron star can be derived. Using a photoionization absorption model, we measure a gravitational redshift of about 1.72, which corresponds to a compactness R/M of 4.46 \\pm 0.13 km per solar mass, or 3.02 \\pm 0.09 in dimensionless units.

Six- axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost."}

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "summary": "Stochastic convex optimization problems with nonlinear functional constraints are ubiquitous in machine learning applications, including multi-task learning, structured prediction, and multi-view learning. The presence of nonlinear functional constraints renders the traditional projected stochastic gradient descent and related projection-based methods inefficient, and motivates the use of first-order methods. However, existing first-order methods, including primal and primal-dual algorithms, typically rely on a bounded (sub-)gradient assumption, which may be too restrictive in many settings.\n  We propose a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) algorithm that works entirely in the primal domain, avoids projecting onto the feasible region, obviates the need for bounded gradients, and achieves state-of-the-art oracle complexity under standard smoothness and convexity assumptions. A faster version, namely SSQP-Skip, is also proposed where the quadratic subproblems can be skipped in most iterations. Finally, we develop an accelerated variance-reduced version of SSQP (VARAS), whose oracle complexity bounds match those for solving unconstrained finite-sum convex optimization problems. The superior performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated via numerical experiments on real datasets."}

A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control."}

Simultaneously, we explicitly model the external pulling disturbances through a spring-damper system and achieve fine-grained force control by manipulating the virtual spring. During this process, the reinforcement-learning policy spontaneously generates disturbance-rejection response by exploiting environmental feedback. Moreover, HAFO employs an asymmetric Actor-Critic framework in which the Critic-network access to privileged spring-damping forces guides the actor-network to learn a generalizable, robust policy for resisting external disturbances.

This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side."}

Rapid information gathering and comprehensive structural assessment of buildings have different requirements and therefore necessitate distinct methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel modular Next-Best-View (NBV) planning framework for aerial robots that explicitly uses a reconstruction quality objective to guide the exploration planning. In particular, our approach introduces new and efficient methods for view generation and selection of viewpoint candidates that are adaptive to the user-defined quality requirements, fully exploiting the uncertainty encoded in a Truncated Signed Distance field (TSDF) representation of the environment. This results in informed and efficient exploration decisions tailored towards the predetermined objective. Finally, we validate our method via extensive simulations in realistic environments. We demonstrate that it successfully adjusts its behavior to the user goal while consistently outperforming conventional NBV strategies in terms of coverage, quality of the final 3D map and path efficiency."}

However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\\%, 11.63\\% and 14.93\\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments."}

Shin"], "title": "Power-Efficient Autonomous Mobile Robots", "comment": "13 pages, 16 figures", "summary": "This paper presents pNav, a novel power-management system that significantly enhances the power/energy-efficiency of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) by jointly optimizing their physical/mechanical and cyber subsystems. By profiling AMRs' power consumption, we identify three challenges in achieving CPS (cyber-physical system) power-efficiency that involve both cyber (C) and physical (P) subsystems: (1) variabilities of system power consumption breakdown, (2) environment-aware navigation locality, and (3) coordination of C and P subsystems. pNav takes a multi-faceted approach to achieve power-efficiency of AMRs. First, it integrates millisecond-level power consumption prediction for both C and P subsystems. Second, it includes novel real-time modeling and monitoring of spatial and temporal navigation localities for AMRs. Third, it supports dynamic coordination of AMR software (navigation, detection) and hardware (motors, DVFS driver) configurations. pNav is prototyped using the Robot Operating System (ROS) Navigation Stack, 2D LiDAR, and camera. Our in-depth evaluation with a real robot and Gazebo environments demonstrates a >96% accuracy in predicting power consumption and a 38.1% reduction in power consumption without compromising navigation accuracy and safety."}

This paper tackles this problem and allows to extend existing rigid-body pose estimation methods to non-rigid systems. Our approach hinges on two core assumptions: first, the elastic properties are captured by an injective deformation-force model, efficiently learned via a Multi-Layer Perceptron; second, we solve the platform's inherently smooth motion using continuous-time B-spline kinematic models. By continuously applying Newton's Second Law, our method establishes a physical link between visually-derived trajectory acceleration and predicted deformation-induced acceleration. We demonstrate that our approach not only enables robust and accurate pose estimation on non-rigid platforms, but that the properly modeled platform physics instigate inertial sensing properties. We demonstrate this feasibility on a simple spring-camera system, and show how it robustly resolves the typically ill-posed problem of metric scale and gravity recovery in monocular visual odometry."}

On the BNCI2014 motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset with 9 subjects and 5,184 trials, the system performs at a high safety rate of 94-97% even with lightweight decoder architectures with low test accuracies (27-46%) and high ECE confidence miscalibration (0.22-0.41). We demonstrate 1.7x correct interventions in simulated noise testing versus at baseline. The monitor operates at 100Hz and sub-millisecond decision latency, making it practically viable for closed-loop neural signal-based systems. Across 21 ablation results, GUARDIAN exhibits a graduated response to signal degradation, and produces auditable traces from intent, plan to action, helping to link neural evidence to verifiable robot action."}

However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training. Experiments show 5-17% success gains on public benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots across different VLA variants."}

The method is derived from a continuous-time dynamical system whose vector field is obtained by solving a convex QCQP that enforces monotonic descent of the objective and forward invariance of the feasible set. The resulting continuous-time dynamics achieve an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate to first-order stationary points under standard constraint qualification conditions. We then propose a safeguarded Euler discretization with adaptive step-size selection that preserves this convergence rate while maintaining both descent and feasibility in discrete time. To enhance scalability, we develop an active-set variant (SS-QCQP-AS) that selectively enforces constraints near the boundary, substantially reducing computational cost without compromising theoretical guarantees. Numerical experiments on a multi-agent nonlinear optimal control problem demonstrate that SS-QCQP and SS-QCQP-AS maintain feasibility, exhibit the predicted convergence behavior, and deliver solution quality comparable to second-order solvers such as SQP and IPOPT."}
