On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon."}

In this work, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the pyrochlore superconductor CsBi2 and spin liquid Pr2Ir2O7 at 0.3 K. For the first time, we obtained atomically resolved images of their (111) surfaces, revealing a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy in CsBi2 reveals a nearly fully opened superconductivity gap. The ratio of 2Δ/kBTC = 4.7 suggests relatively strong coupling superconductivity, as compared with that in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs). In contrast to the previous study categorizing CsBi2 as a type-I superconductor, the applied magnetic field induces a hexagonal vortex lattice in which each vortex core exhibits an intriguing three-fold symmetry state. In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence. We discuss the relations of these many-body electronic phenomena with the pyrochlore lattice geometry and its charge or spin frustration. Our systematic observations offer atomic-scale insights into the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductors and spin liquids."}

Existing {\\it ab initio} methods either capture bias-dependent transport but neglect dynamical correlations or include correlations but are restricted to equilibrium or linear-response regimes. To overcome these limitations, we present a framework for steady-state quantum transport, combining density functional theory (DFT), the non-equilibrium Greens' function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The framework is then applied to Cu/Co/vacuum/Cu and an Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction. In Co, correlations drive a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior under finite bias, due to scattering of electrons with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments."}

AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform (AUTOSAR AP) is widely adopted in development to meet these criteria; however, licensing constraints and tool implementation challenges limit its use in research. Conversely, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is predominantly used in research within the autonomous driving domain, leading to a disparity between research and development platforms that hinders swift commercialization. This paper proposes a collaboration framework that enables AUTOSAR AP and ROS 2 to communicate with each other using a Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems (DDS). In contrast, AUTOSAR AP uses Scalable service-Oriented Middleware over IP (SOME/IP) for communication. The proposed framework bridges these protocol differences, ensuring seamless interaction between the two platforms. We validate the functionality and performance of our bridge converter through empirical analysis, demonstrating its efficiency in conversion time and ease of integration with ROS 2 tools. Furthermore, the availability of the proposed collaboration framework is improved by automatically generating a configuration file for the proposed bridge converter."}

This yields probabilistic, data-driven performance guarantees in terms of the expectation or conditional value-at-risk of the selected performance metric.

Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the process of collecting high-quality data is unavoidable. Since DQM relies on real experimental data, it is inherently tied to the specific detector substructure and technology in operation. In this work, a simulation-driven approach to DQM is proposed, enabling the study and development of data-quality methodologies in a controlled environment. Using a modified version of Delphes -- a fast, multi-purpose detector simulation -- the preliminary realization of a framework is demonstrated which leverages ML to identify detector anomalies as well as localize the malfunctioning components responsible. We introduce MEDIC (Monitoring for Event Data Integrity and Consistency), a neural network designed to learn detector behavior and perform DQM tasks to look for potential faults. Although the present implementation adopts a simplified setup for computational ease, where large detector regions are deliberately deactivated to mimic faults, this work represents an initial step toward a comprehensive ML-based DQM framework.

The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep.

This research addresses this critical gap by developing a large-scale, calibrated agent-based model for supplier selection, complemented by a probabilistic heuristic for international shipments. Our approach integrates trade relationships between industry sectors, transportation costs, and supplier rating model adapted from existing literature. The model's core objective is to minimize the discrepancy between modeled and observed commodity flows while ensuring a close match to regional shipping distance distributions. Implemented and tested across four major U.S. metropolitan areas, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Los Angeles, the model demonstrates high fidelity in replicating observed freight patterns. Key findings reveal consistent alignment with national shipping distance trends and highlight significant spatial variations in commodity trade assignments and demand across the study regions. This behaviorally informed and transport-sensitive framework is designed to approximate real-world decision-making, providing a robust tool for policymakers and planners to evaluate targeted interventions, assess infrastructure investments, and enhance supply chain resilience in the face of disruptions."}

This generates knowledge gaps for the sustainable management of hydrobiological resources and their nexus with society. We developed ECOSAIC (Ecological Compression via Orthogonal Specialized Autoencoders for Interpretable Classification), an Artificial Intelligence framework for automatic classification of benthic habitats through interpretable latent representations using a customizable autoencoder. ECOSAIC compresses n-dimensional feature space by optimizing specialization and orthogonality between domain-informed features. We employed two domain-informed categories: biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological, that together integrate biological, physicochemical, hydrological and geomorphological, features, whose constraints on habitats have been recognized in ecology for a century. We applied the model to the Colombian Pacific Ocean and the results revealed 16 benthic habitats, expanding from mangroves to deep rocky areas up to 1000 m depth. The candidate habitats exhibited a strong correspondence between their environmental constraints, represented in latent space, and their expected species composition. This correspondence reflected meaningful ecological associations rather than purely statistical correlations, where the habitat's environmental offerings align semantically with the species' requirements. This approach could improve the management and conservation of benthic habitats, facilitating the development of functional maps that support marine planning, biodiversity conservation and fish stock assessment. We also hope it provides new insights into how ecological principles can inform AI frameworks, particularly given the substantial data limitations that characterize ecological research."}

In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'>0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit.

Machine learning is increasingly used for EEA by modeling rare weather events otherwise too complex or computationally intensive to model using traditional simulation methods. However, the validity of using machine learning in this context remains unclear, particularly as high-stakes machine learning applications in general are criticized for inherent bias and lack of robustness. Here we use machine learning and simulation analyses to evaluate EEA in the context of California wildfire data from 2003-2020. We identify three major threats to validity: (1) individual event attribution estimates are highly sensitive to algorithmic design choices; (2) common performance metrics like area under the ROC curve or Brier score are not strongly correlated with attribution error, facilitating suboptimal model selection; and (3) distribution shift -- changes in temperature across climate scenarios -- substantially degrades predictive performance. To address these challenges, we propose a more valid and robust attribution analysis based on aggregate machine learning estimates, using an additional metric -- mean calibration error -- to assess model performance, and using subgroup and propensity diagnostics to assess distribution shift."}

In addition to our Hα images, we have obtained matched continuum images which we subtract to reveal faint emission, including a far more extensive network of optical knots and filaments than reported previously. The deepest images also show an extremely faint, fairly diffuse arc of emission surrounding much of the circumference of Tycho to the southeast and south, coinciding with the rim of the radio/X-ray shell. We have measured proper motions for 46 filaments, including many fainter ones near the Tycho outer rim. Our measurements are generally consistent with previous ones by Kamper and vandenBergh (1978), but ours have far greater precision. Most optical filaments at the shell rim have expansion indices reasonably consistent with the Sedov value (0.40), while the interior filaments have somewhat smaller values, as expected. From the combination of proper motions of filaments at the shell rim and shock velocity at the same positions, one should be able to calculate the distance to Tycho by simple geometry. Determination of the shock velocity from broad Balmer-line profiles is subject to model uncertainties, but the availability of dozens of such filaments with a range of conditions offers the possibility to substantially improve the distance determination for Tycho."}

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."}

Working on the idèle class space, we place a real--place Floquet Hamiltonian into an off--diagonal chiral form to obtain a global adelic Dirac operator with an exact involutive symmetry implemented by real reflection and idelic inversion. Arithmetic information is incorporated through a prime--indexed mass deformation built from spherical Hecke operators; when the coefficient functions are even, the perturbed operator preserves the chiral symmetry and produces isolated $\\pm$--paired eigenvalues inside the spectral gaps of the Floquet background. These eigenvalues appear as jump discontinuities of the Dirac spectral shift function, while a separated adelic trace formula expresses the trace as a product of a Floquet orbital factor and a prime--indexed Euler--factor--type term whose logarithmic derivatives yield a prime--orbit expansion reminiscent of the explicit formula. This structure motivates a Dirac reinterpretation of the Hilbert--Pólya idea, identifying the nontrivial zeros of $ζ(s)$ not with the raw spectrum of a single operator but with the spectral--shift discontinuities of a chiral adelic Dirac system under controlled prime--indexed deformations, with finite--prime truncations providing computable models that converge distributionally and enable numerical exploration of arithmetic spectral flow."}

Existing models often rely on restricted, hand-picked strategy sets, which can overlook critical behavioural pathways. A recent four-strategy framework showed that cheap talk can promote cooperation through local interactions, yet it remained unclear whether modelled strategies might alter these conclusions. Here, we extend this framework to the complete set of eight strategies that naturally arise from communication and decision-making rules. We show that incorporating the full strategy space dramatically changes the evolutionary landscape. Cooperation becomes both more robust and more versatile, driven by novel pathways absent in the restricted model. In particular, we uncover a previously overlooked mechanism in which suspicious cooperation catalyses a cyclic dynamic that sustains cooperation. Conversely, the assumed role of strategic defection in the biased model is fragile, acting mainly as a spoiler rather than a genuine evolutionary attractor. The complete model further reveals a rich spectrum of long-term behaviours, including stable coexistence among up to seven strategies and time-varying patterns of partial coexistence. These results demonstrate that the full strategy space unlocks hidden routes to cooperative behaviour and highlight the importance of comprehensive modelling when explaining the emergence of cooperation."}

This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour."}

The approach extends the geometric theory of relativistic continua introduced in Part I to include polarization, magnetization, and general elastic-electromagnetic coupling through a unified energy functional. By exploiting spacetime and material covariance, the framework yields the corresponding spacetime and convective variational principles, together with transparent expressions for the stress-energy-momentum tensor and the covariant Euler-type balance equations governing nonlinear electromagnetic continua. Coupling to general relativity is naturally incorporated, and when the action is augmented with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms, the gravitational and electromagnetic junction conditions follow directly from the variational formulation. The results provide a coherent foundation for modeling nonlinear electromagnetic continua in relativistic regimes, with relevance to astrophysical systems where relativistic continuum dynamics and electromagnetic fields are known to be strongly coupled, such as neutron-star crusts, magnetar flares, relativistic jets, and accretion disks.

We extend classical optical flow formulations by integrating them with depth modeling strategies tailored to the geometry for lunar/planetary approach, descent, and landing, specifically, planar and spherical terrain approximations parameterized by a laser rangefinder. Motion field inversion is performed through a least-squares framework, using sparse optical flow features extracted via the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm.

The results demonstrate accurate velocity estimation from approach to landing, with sub-10% error for complex terrain and on the order of 1% for more typical terrain, as well as performances suitable for real-time applications.

Using this reformulation, our approach takes advantage of massive parallelism across both scenarios and transitions, enabling the simultaneous evaluation of \\emph{over one million uncertainty realizations} in a single GPU pass -- a scale far beyond the reach of existing methods. We instantiate the framework in two canonical applications: the capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand and a dynamic stochastic inventory routing problem. In both cases, DP subroutines traditionally considered sequential are redesigned to harness two- or three-dimensional GPU parallelism. Experiments demonstrate near-linear scaling in the number of scenarios and yield one to three orders of magnitude speedups over multithreaded CPU baselines, resulting in tighter SAA estimates and significantly stronger first-stage decisions under fixed time budgets. Beyond these applications, our work establishes a general-purpose recipe for transforming classical DP routines into high-throughput GPU primitives, substantially expanding the computational frontier of stochastic discrete optimization to the million-scenario scale."}

But transmissions in this band are highly vulnerable to attenuation and blockages from humans, buildings, and foliage, which increase end-to-end packet delays. This work designs dynamic scheduling policies that minimize end-to-end packet delays while keeping packet transmission costs low. Specifically, we consider a mmWave network that consists of a transmitter that transmits data packets over an unreliable communication channel modeled as a Gilbert-Elliott channel.The transmitter operates under an ACK/NACK feedback model and does not observe the channel state unless it attempts a transmission. The objective is to minimize a weighted average cost consisting of end-to-end packet delays and packet transmission costs. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first POMDP formulation for mmWave network with partial channel state information that considers delay minimization. We show that the POMDP admits a solution that has a threshold structure, i.e., for each queue length, the belief (the conditional probability that the channel is in a good state) is partitioned into intervals, and the transmitter sends j packets when the belief lies in the j-th interval. We then consider the case when the system parameters such as the packet arrival rate, and the transition probabilities of the channel are not known, and leverage these structural results in order to use the actor-critic algorithm to efficiently search for a policy that is locally optimal."}

In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\\mathcal{RH}_N(\\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$."}

In this paper, we explore the performance and robustness of diffusion policy learning as a promising solution for contact-sensitive robotic assembly at construction scale, using timber mortise and tenon joints as a case study. A two-phase study is conducted: first, to evaluate policy performance and applicability; second, to assess robustness in handling fabrication uncertainties simulated as randomized perturbations to the mortise position. The best-performing policy achieved a total average success rate of 75% with perturbations up to 10 mm, including 100% success in unperturbed cases. The results demonstrate the potential of sensory-motor diffusion policies to generalize to a wide range of complex, contact-rich assembly tasks across construction and manufacturing, advancing robotic construction under uncertainty and contributing to safer, more efficient building practices."}

However, many real-world systems, including logistics, supply chains, communication networks, and reliability-aware infrastructures, exhibit inherently ternary dependencies among cost, time, and risk that cannot be decomposed into pairwise components.\n  This paper introduces the \\emph{Ternary Tropical Gamma Semiring} (TTGS), a $Γ$-indexed algebraic structure that generalizes tropical semirings by replacing binary additive composition with a non-separable ternary operator. We establish the axioms of TTGS, prove associativity, distributivity, and monotonicity, and show that TTGS forms a well-structured foundation for multi-parameter optimization.\n  Building on this framework, we develop TTGS-Pathfinder, a ternary analogue of the Bellman--Ford algorithm. We derive its dynamic-programming recurrence, prove correctness through an invariant-based argument, analyze convergence under the TTGS order, and obtain an $O(n^2 m)$ complexity bound.\n  Applications demonstrate that TTGS naturally models systems whose behaviour depends on triadic cost interactions, offering a principled alternative to binary tropical, vector, or scalarized multi-objective methods."}

Empirical observations typically find either a many-eyes strategy with all (or many) group members maintaining a low level of individual vigilance, or a sentinel strategy with one (or a few) individuals maintaining a high level of individual vigilance while others do not. With a general analytical treatment that makes minimal assumptions, we show that these two strategies are alternate solutions to the same adaptive problem of balancing the costs of predation and vigilance. Which strategy is preferred depends on how costs scale with the level of individual vigilance: many-eyes strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise gently at low levels but become steeper at higher levels (convex; e.g. an open field); sentinel strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise steeply at low levels and then flatten out (concave; e.g. environments with vantage points). This same dichotomy emerges whether individuals act selfishly to optimise their own fitness or cooperatively to optimise group fitness. The model is extended to explain discrete behavioural switching between strategies and differential levels of vigilance such as edge effects."}

Here we introduce a general and numerically efficient framework to diagnose mixed-state topological phases in strongly interacting systems via the disorder parameter (DP) of the U(1) charge operator. Specifically, from the finite-size scaling of the second derivative of the DP generating function, we introduce the topological scaling indicator, which exhibits a characteristic linear scaling with the system's linear dimension for topological phases, a signature that vanishes upon transition into a topologically trivial phase. Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures. This work provides a powerful and accessible tool for the numerical exploration of topological phenomena in interacting mixed states, opening a pathway to study systems previously inaccessible due to computational obstacles."}

The broken power law emerges as the most common spectral shape, accounting for 60\\% of pulsars, while the simple power law describes only 13.5\\%, with 68.8\\% of pulsars decisively favoring curved or broken models.

Dykstra's algorithm is an iterative scheme for computing the Euclidean projection of an initial point onto the intersection of convex sets by successively projecting onto each set. Its low per-iteration computational cost makes it well-suited for solving large-scale or real-time problems where traditional optimisation routines become computationally burdensome. Despite its strong convergence guarantees, Dykstra's algorithm is known to suffer from stalling -- arbitrarily long intervals during which the primal iterates remain constant -- rendering its runtime unpredictable and severely limiting its applicability in time-critical settings. Focusing on polyhedral constraint sets, we derive a closed-form solution for the length of the stalling period once stalling is detected. This result enables a modified, stall-averse version of Dykstra's algorithm that fast-forwards the stalling period via a single, inexpensive update while preserving convergence guarantees. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence behaviour, establishing the proposed method as a practical enhancement for a broad class of projection-based algorithms."}

Firstly, opposite evolutions of spectral lag are found in the first and third pulse of this burst. Second, the large negative lag of the first pulse is an outlier in short GRB sample, especially when the pulse duration is considered. Spectral analysis shows that the negative lag of the first pulse is caused by the evolution of spectrum index, and is irrelevant to Epeak, which is inconsistent with the previous study. The intrinsic mechanism is probably attributed to electron cooling in the decaying magnetic field, which leads to the continuous hardening of the spectrum index and results in negative lag. Furthermore, spectral analysis also shows that the third pulse is more likely to be described by a quasi-thermal spectrum, indicating the existence of photospheric emission. It is difficult to explain how the synchrotron radiation appears before photospheric emission in a single GRB and some assumptions are discussed."}

In this paper, we develop a two-step generalized radial basis function-generated finite difference (gRBF-FD) method for solving PDEs on manifolds without boundaries, identified by randomly sampled point cloud data. The gRBF-FD is based on polyharmonic spline kernels and multivariate polynomials (PHS+Poly) defined over the tangent space in a local Monge coordinate system. The first step is to regress the local target function using a generalized moving least squares (GMLS) while the second step is to compensate for the residual using a PHS interpolation. Our gRBF-FD method has the same interpolant form with the standard RBF-FD but differs in interpolation coefficients. Our approach utilizes a specific weight function in both the GMLS and PHS steps and implements an automatic tuning strategy for the stencil size K (i.e., the number of nearest neighbors) at each point. These strategies are designed to produce a Laplacian matrix with a specific coefficient structure, thereby enhancing stability and reducing the solution error. We establish an error bound for the operator approximation in terms of the so-called local stencil diameter as well as in terms of the number of data. We further demonstrate the high accuracy of gRBF-FD through numerical tests on various smooth manifolds."}

It is found that the flux of the photon ring increases simultaneously as the flux of the direct ring, which brightens first, decreases, and then gradually diminishes, when the increase in emissivity persists for $15 t_{\\rm g}$ with $t_{\\rm g}$ being the light crossing time of the gravitational radius. The direct ring is formed by photons emitted from the vicinity of the innermost region of the disk and traveling directly to the observer without orbiting around the black hole, while the photon ring is formed by photons passing near the spherical photon orbit. The time-averaged width of the dark region between the direct ring and the photon ring (dark crescent) becomes thinner when the spin parameter is higher and the increase in the emissivity of the accretion disk is greater. The time variation of two rings also causes the intensity-weighted center to oscillate both in the direction of the black hole's angular momentum vector projected onto the screen ($Y$-direction) and in the perpendicular direction ($X$-direction). The amplitude of oscillatory time variation in the $X$-direction becomes large when the spin parameter is higher, and that in the $Y$-direction becomes large when the increase in the emissivity of the disk is large. The spin parameter can be estimated by combining the time-averaged dark crescent width and the ratio of the amplitudes in the $X$- and $Y$-directions. This method is applicable when the duration of the increase in emissivity of the accretion disk ranges at least from approximately 10-20 $t_{\\rm g}$."}

While recent optimization-based methods such as Hierarchical Task Model Predictive Control (HTMPC) enable efficient multitask execution with strict task priorities, they have so far been applied mainly to static or structured scenarios. Extending these approaches to dynamic human-centered environments requires predictive models that capture how humans react to the actions of the robot. This work introduces Safe Mobile Manipulation with Interactive Human Prediction via Task-Hierarchical Bilevel Model Predictive Control (SM$^2$ITH), a unified framework that combines HTMPC with interactive human motion prediction through bilevel optimization that jointly accounts for robot and human dynamics. The framework is validated on two different mobile manipulators, the Stretch 3 and the Ridgeback-UR10, across three experimental settings: (i) delivery tasks with different navigation and manipulation priorities, (ii) sequential pick-and-place tasks with different human motion prediction models, and (iii) interactions involving adversarial human behavior. Our results highlight how interactive prediction enables safe and efficient coordination, outperforming baselines that rely on weighted objectives or open-loop human models."}

A strategy is presented to improve the potential of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope to detect core-collapse supernovae in our Galaxy or the Large Magellanic Cloud by further exploiting the properties of its optical modules equipped with multiple photomultipliers. A supernova burst is expected to produce a sudden hit rate increase in the KM3NeT detectors. New observables have been defined for individual optical modules that exploit the geometry and time distribution of the detected hits, enabling a better discrimination between signal and background signatures. In addition, a thorough investigation of the related systematic uncertainties is presented for the first time. When implemented, this new methodology allowed KM3NeT to probe 46% more Galactic core-collapse supernova candidates than with the previous trigger strategy, reaching the dense Galactic bulge. It is now expected that, once completed, KM3NeT will achieve full Galactic sensitivity to core-collapse supernovae."}

Concurrently, several works have demonstrated that simple learning objectives, such as L1 regression, can achieve performance comparable to denoising-based methods on certain tasks, while offering faster convergence and inference. In this paper, we focus on how to combine the advantages of these two paradigms: retaining the ability of denoising models to capture multi-modal distributions and avoid mode collapse while achieving the efficiency of the L1 regression objective. To achieve this vision, we reformulate the original v-prediction flow matching and transform it into sample-prediction with the L1 training objective. We empirically show that the multi-modality can be expressed via a single ODE step. Thus, we propose \\textbf{L1 Flow}, a two-step sampling schedule that generates a suboptimal action sequence via a single integration step and then reconstructs the precise action sequence through a single prediction. The proposed method largely retains the advantages of flow matching while reducing the iterative neural function evaluations to merely two and mitigating the potential performance degradation associated with direct sample regression. We evaluate our method with varying baselines and benchmarks, including 8 tasks in MimicGen, 5 tasks in RoboMimic \\& PushT Bench, and one task in the real-world scenario.

The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\\mathcal{RH}_N(\\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $β=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$."}

As the first theoretical result, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the false positive error incurred by the algorithm for attacks that are 2-step honest, referring to adversaries that act intermittently rather than successively. Moreover, we establish that for adversaries possessing a certain minimum energy, the false negative error incurred by AD-CPS is low.

A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R_0 \\approx 2\\times10^4~{\\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys."}

While existing studies primarily attribute the inconsistency to observability mismatch, these analyses are often based on simplified theoretical formulations that consider only prediction and SLAM correction. Such formulations fail to cover the non-standard estimation steps, such as MSCKF correction and delayed initialization, which are critical for practical VINS estimators. Furthermore, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how inconsistency dynamically emerges across estimation steps has hindered the development of precise and efficient solutions. As a result, current approaches often face a trade-off between estimator accuracy, consistency, and implementation complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel analysis framework termed Unobservable Subspace Evolution (USE), which systematically characterizes how the unobservable subspace evolves throughout the entire estimation pipeline by explicitly tracking changes in its evaluation points. This perspective sheds new light on how individual estimation steps contribute to inconsistency. Our analysis reveals that observability misalignment induced by certain steps is the antecedent of observability mismatch. Guided by this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution paradigm, Unobservable Subspace Alignment (USA), which eliminates inconsistency by selectively intervening only in those estimation steps that induce misalignment. We design two USA methods: transformation-based and re-evaluation-based, both offering accurate and computationally lightweight solutions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}

Unlike traditional methods that classify integrals as singular, nearly singular, or regular, our approach employs a desingularizing change of variables that smoothly adapts to the physical distance from singularities in the boundary integral kernels. The transformation intensifies near the polar point and progressively weakens when integrating over portions of the domain that are farther from it, ultimately leaving the integrand unchanged in the limit of a diametrically opposed region. This automatic calibration enhances accuracy and robustness by eliminating the traditional classification step, to which the approximation quality is often highly sensitive. Moreover, integration is performed directly over B-spline supports rather than over individual elements, reducing computational cost, particularly for higher-degree splines. The proposed method is validated through boundary element benchmarks for the three dimensional Stokes problem, where we achieve excellent convergence rates."}

However, their perception often depends on external sensors, which increase hardware complexity and limit scalability. This work introduces a unified multi-dynamics modeling framework for tendon-driven continuum robotic systems, exemplified by a spiral-inspired robot named Spirob. The framework integrates motor electrical dynamics, motor-winch dynamics, and continuum robot dynamics into a coherent system model. Within this framework, motor signals such as current and angular displacement are modeled to expose the electromechanical signatures of external interactions, enabling perception grounded in intrinsic dynamics. The model captures and validates key physical behaviors of the real system, including actuation hysteresis and self-contact at motion limits. Building on this foundation, the framework is applied to environmental interaction: first for passive contact detection, verified experimentally against simulation data; then for active contact sensing, where control and perception strategies from simulation are successfully applied to the real robot; and finally for object size estimation, where a policy learned in simulation is directly deployed on hardware. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides a physically grounded way to interpret interaction signatures from intrinsic motor signals in tendon-driven continuum robots."}

Massive improvements in computing power and optimisation techniques has led to renewed interest in learning globally optimal decision trees. Empirical evidence shows that optimal classification trees (OCTs) have better out-of-sample performance than heuristic methods. The dominant optimisation paradigms for training OCTs are mixed-integer programming (MIP) and dynamic programming (DP). MIP formulations offer flexibility in the objectives and constraints that are modelled, but suffer from poor scaling in the size of the training dataset and the maximum tree depth. DP models represent the state of the art in scaling for OCTs, but lack some of the flexibility of MIP models. In this paper we present progress on using advanced integer programming methods to integrate ideas from DP models into MIP formulations to begin bridging the scaling gap. Using the existing BendOCT model from the literature as a base model, we introduce valid inequalities, cutting planes, and a primal heuristic to improve the scaling of MIP formulations. We show that these techniques significantly improve the ability of BendOCT to find provably optimal solutions over a wide range of datasets."}

For problems limited by the memory capacity of current supercomputers, we expect a memory footprint reduction of about an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm by solving two model problems. Depending on the PDE and polynomial degree, but irrespective of the problem size, the solution vector on the finest grid requires between 4 and 12 bits per DoF, and the residual and correction require 3 to 6 bits each. Additional data is stored on the coarse grids with modestly increasing bit widths toward coarser grids."}

Raiteri"], "title": "The variability of blazars throughout the electromagnetic spectrum", "comment": "Review article published by The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review", "summary": "With their jet pointing towards us, blazars are ideal tools to study the physics and structure of extragalactic jets. Their powerful jets are cosmic particle accelerators and are alleged to be one of the production sites of the high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. Doppler beaming of the jet nonthermal radiation increases blazar brightness, blue-shifts their emission, and shortens their variability time scales, which are observed to range from years down to minutes. This review will focus on blazar flux, spectral, and polarization variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Interpretation of blazar variability calls into question both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Shock waves, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence can accelerate particles inside the jet, while jet precession, rotation, and twisting can produce variations in Doppler beaming. Microvariability puts strong constraints on the size of the emitting regions, suggesting a multizone emitting jet. Twisting jets have been proposed to explain the long-term multiwavelength variability. They are supported by radio observations of bent or helical jets, and by results of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of plasma jets. Detection of (quasi)periodic behaviour has been ascribed to orbital motion in black hole binary systems, jet precession, kink instabilities developing inside the jet, or perturbations in the accretion disc. Gravitational microlensing has been suggested to explain blazar behaviour in some cases. Polarization provides information on the structure and behaviour of the magnetic field in the emission zones. Both the degree and angle of polarization can show strong and fast variability, which is sometimes correlated with flux. The interpretation of flux, spectral, and polarization variability within a consistent picture challenges current models of blazar variability."}

In this work, we present EchoVLA, a memory-aware VLA model for long-horizon mobile manipulation. EchoVLA incorporates a synergistic declarative memory inspired by the human brain, consisting of a scene memory that maintains a collection of spatial-semantic maps and an episodic memory that stores task-level experiences with multimodal contextual features. During both training and inference, the two memories are individually stored, updated, and retrieved based on current observations, task history, and instructions, and their retrieved representations are fused via coarse- and fine-grained attention to guide mobile-arm diffusion policies. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we further introduce MoMani, an automated benchmark that generates expert-level long-horizon trajectories through multimodal large language model (MLLM)-guided planning and feedback-driven refinement, supplemented with real-robot demonstrations. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that EchoVLA improves long-horizon performance, reaching 0.52 SR on manipulation/navigation and 0.31 on mobile manipulation, exceeding $π_{0.5}$ by +0.08 and +0.11."}

In this paper, geometric methods employing properties of similar right angled triangles have been devised for performing error free scientific calculations without the use of batteries. Based on this method, a mechanical analogue calculator has also been designed. A right-angled triangle with one perpendicular side of unit length is drawn, and from the vertex of the right angle, a perpendicular is drawn onto the hypotenuse. From the point of intersection of this perpendicular with the hypotenuse, another perpendicular is drawn to the base, and this process is continued until n perpendiculars are drawn. The resultant figure is a right angled triangle containing n similar triangles. Using properties of similar triangles, it is found that the lengths of the first, second, third so on till last perpendicular form a geometric series. If the length of the nth perpendicular is equated to a given real positive quantity less than one, and the base angle is adjusted, then the length of the first perpendicular represents the nth root of the given quantity. If the given quantity is greater than one, its reciprocal is equated to the length of the nth perpendicular, and the reciprocal of the first perpendicular gives the nth root. In this manner, several scientific calculations can be performed using geometric techniques."}

In this paper, we report on the optical transients we found either during the development of this tool, or when applying the classifier to the existing archive. We use this sample to anticipate what improvements to the TDE detection systems will need to be implemented for future surveys. For all the transients, we present optical and infrared archival photometry from ZTF, WISE, and Catalina, and assess the previous nuclear activity of the host. We fit the ZTF lightcurves with both a phenomenological and a physically-motivated model. We report on a total of 19 optical nuclear transients, out of which nine are in passive galaxies, eight in active galaxies, and two for which the activity of the host is uncertain. Two transients are newly discovered repeated TDE candidates, and we compare them to the current sample of repeated optical nuclear transients. One transient is exceptionally long-lived (over 5 years), in an until-now passive galaxy. Three of the TDE-like flares in active galaxies have absolute g-band magnitudes brighter than -24, making them new Extreme Nuclear Transient (ENT) candidates. One seemingly repeated object was revealed to be two independent supernovae in the same galaxy. This sample shows both the potential of our detection system for future discovery, and the relevance of archival searches to reveal overlooked transients.

This formulation enhances the clarity and visibility of both the object and the gripper in the policy's observations. As a result, we enable the training of ambidextrous policies on observations that remain closer to the occlusion-free training distribution, leading to more robust policies.

Unfortunately many control design problems are non-convex: approximations, relaxations, or iterative schemes are usually employed to solve them. Several such approaches have been developed in the literature, for example Sum-of-Squares (SOSs) methods have been used for systems described by polynomial dynamics. Alternatively, and relevant to this paper, one can choose a (non-unique) linear-like representation of the system and solve the resulting state-dependent Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) or use SOSs optimisation techniques to derive a control law. This SOS method has been shown to effectively design polynomial and rational controllers for nonlinear polynomial systems, offering a broader class of controllers and the potential for improved performance and robustness guarantees. In this paper, we start off by considering rational functions as controllers for nonlinear systems and propose a procedure for designing such controllers by iteratively solving convex SOS optimisation problems. Our approach decouples the controller structure from the system dynamics and incorporates it as a constraint within the optimisation problem, which results in an optimisation that co-designs aspects of the controller and the Lyapunov function at the same iterative step. We theoretically establish the properties of this procedure by showing that several existing rational controller design methods can be recovered as special cases of this procedure. The proposed method is evaluated on various nonlinear benchmark system examples, demonstrating improved performance and robustness over both polynomial controllers and rational controllers obtained by existing approaches."}

Ejection of CEs leads to tightened stellar orbits capable of forming compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. As these mergers are seen by gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK), we ask what the merger rates of compact binaries in LVK tell us about the fraction of LRNe that lead to the formation of compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Using the observed volumetric rates of LRNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and of compact binary mergers from LVK observations, we derive limits on the fraction of LRNe that produce compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Assuming the LRNe rate closely follows the star formation rate at any redshift, we use the delay time distribution models for compact binaries to compute the compact binary merger rate. A comparison of this merger rate with the latest volumetric rates of compact binary mergers from the fourth GW transient catalog (GWTC-4) at the present epoch of LVK allows us to constrain the above fraction. We find that only a fraction as small as $\\sim 10^{-3}$ (median) of the LRNe correspond to the GW-observed binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This potentially implies that the majority of the LRNe population will not lead to mergers of compact objects, but other end products, such as stellar mergers."}

Trust-region (TR) methods provide a robust framework for grey-box problems by combining accurate glass-box derivatives with local reduced models (RMs) for black-box components. However, existing TR approaches often involve complex multi-layered formulations requiring extensive parameter tuning, or lack open-source implementations. Motivated by the recent advances in funnel-based convergence theory for nonlinear optimisation and the TR filter method, we propose a novel TR funnel algorithm for grey-box optimisation that replaces the filter acceptance criterion with a generalisable uni-dimensional funnel, maintaining a monotonically non-increasing upper bound on approximation error of the local black-box RMs. A global convergence proof to a first-order critical point is established. The algorithm, implemented in an open-source Pyomo framework, supports multiple RM forms and globalisation strategies (filter or funnel). Benchmark tests on seven numerical and engineering problems show that the TR funnel algorithm achieves comparable and often improved performance relative to the classical TR filter method. The TR funnel method thus provides a simpler, and extensible alternative for large-scale grey-box optimisation."}

Historically, the apparent speeds of black hole x-ray binary (BHXRBs) jets have been observed to be lower than jet speeds from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and specifically blazars. In this work, we show that selection effects could be the primary cause of the observed population differences. For the first time, it is possible to perform a statistical analysis of the underlying BHXRB jet Lorentz factor distribution. We use both the Anderson-Darling test and apply nested sampling to this problem. With Bayes factors, we confirm that the Lorentz factor distribution of BHXRBs is best described with a power law, the same model that has been applied to AGN jets. For a Lorentz factor distribution following $\\rm N(Γ) \\propto Γ^b$ we find a value for the exponent of $b=-2.64_{-0.55}^{+0.46}$. This exponent is consistent with values found in AGN population studies, within $1σ$ for \\textit{Swift}-BAT and \\textit{Fermi}-LAT selected AGN. The best-fit exponent for the radio selected MOJAVE sample is just above our $2 σ$ limit. This is a remarkable agreement given the different scales at which the jets are observed. The observed slower apparent speeds in BHXRBs are largely due to the much larger inclinations in this sample. Furthermore, nested sampling confirms that $Γ_{\\rm max}$ is completely unconstrained using this method. Therefore, based on kinematics alone, BHXRB jets are broadly consistent with being just as relativistic as those from supermassive black holes."}

The global planner offers distribution-free safety guarantees for long-horizon navigation, while the local planner mitigates inaccuracies in obstacle trajectory predictions through adaptive CP, enabling robust and responsive motion in dynamic environments. To further enhance trajectory feasibility, we introduce an adaptive quantile mechanism in the CP-based uncertainty quantification. Instead of using a fixed confidence level, the quantile is automatically tuned to the optimal value that preserves trajectory feasibility, allowing the planner to adaptively tighten safety margins in regions with higher uncertainty.

One potential candidate for dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is predicted by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. After becoming gravitationally bound in cosmic structures, WIMPs can self-annihilate and produce SM particles including neutrinos, which are observable by detectors like IceCube. We present a search for neutrinos from low-mass $(\\leq 300 \\, \\mathrm{GeV})$ WIMP annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with over seven years of IceCube livetime. We find no statistically significant evidence of neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation, and therefore set upper limits on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section $\\left<σv\\right>$. Our strongest upper limits at the 90\\% confidence level are $\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(10^{-22} \\, \\mathrm{{cm}^{3} \\, s^{-1}}\\right)$ for WIMP annihilation directly into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. For our least sensitive channel, the corresponding limits are $\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(10^{-20} \\, \\mathrm{{cm}^{3} \\, s^{-1}}\\right)$, which is an improvement of over two orders of magnitude over previous IceCube limits from dwarf galaxies at the upper end of our mass range."}

Conventional approaches typically rely on sampling-based planners such as MPPI to generate short-term control actions that aim to minimize traversal time and risk measures derived from the traversability estimates. These planners can react quickly but optimize only over a short look-ahead window, limiting their ability to reason about the full path geometry, which is important for navigating in challenging off-road environments. Moreover, they lack the ability to adjust speed based on the terrain bumpiness, which is important for smooth navigation on challenging terrains. In this paper, we introduce TRAIL (Traversability with an Implicit Learned Representation), an off-road navigation framework that leverages an implicit neural representation to continuously parameterize terrain properties. This representation yields spatial gradients that enable integration with a novel gradient-based trajectory optimization method that adapts the path geometry and speed profile based on terrain traversability."}

We first give a general, deterministic result on properties of second-order critical points for a general class of loss functions; we then specialize this result to the nonsmooth amplitude loss and, additionally, prove nearly identical results for a smooth reformulation (similar to PhaseCut) as a synchronization problem over spheres. Finally, we show the usefulness of these tools by proving high-probability landscape guarantees in two settings: (1) phase retrieval with isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, and (2) phase retrieval in a general (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space with Gaussian measurements. In both cases, our results give state-of-the-art and statistically optimal guarantees with only a constant amount of overparametrization (in the well-studied case of isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, such statistical guarantees had previously required greater degrees of overparametrization/relaxation); this demonstrates the potential of overparametrized nonconvex optimization as a principled and scalable algorithmic approach to phase retrieval."}

Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by <10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events."}

A promising direction is learning high-level, symbolic abstractions of the low-level skills of the agents, enabling reasoning and planning independent of the low-level state space. Among possible high-level representations, object-centric skill abstraction with symbolic predicates has been proven to be efficient because of its compatibility with domain-independent planners. Recent advances in foundation models have made it possible to generate symbolic predicates that operate on raw sensory inputs, a process we call generative predicate invention, to facilitate downstream abstraction learning. However, it remains unclear which formal properties the learned representations must satisfy, and how they can be learned to guarantee these properties. In this paper, we address both questions by presenting a formal theory of generative predicate invention for skill abstraction, resulting in symbolic operators that can be used for provably sound and complete planning. Within this framework, we propose SkillWrapper, a method that leverages foundation models to actively collect robot data and learn human-interpretable, plannable representations of black-box skills, using only RGB image observations. Our extensive empirical evaluation in simulation and on real robots shows that SkillWrapper learns abstract representations that enable solving unseen, long-horizon tasks in the real world with black-box skills."}

To further enhance computational efficiency, this paper proposes a quotient-manifold-based optimization framework that leverages the underlying Riemannian geometry in a matrix factorization space. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between spectral-sparse signals and matrix equivalence classes under the action of the real orthogonal group, where each class member corresponds to a rank-constrained positive-semidefinite Hankel-Toeplitz structured matrix. The associated quotient manifold geometry--including the Riemannian metric, horizontal space, retraction, and vector transport--is rigorously derived. Based on these results, we develop a Riemannian conjugate gradient descent algorithm, where each iteration is efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) by exploiting the Hankel and Toeplitz structures. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in both computational speed and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

Trust-region (TR) methods provide a robust framework for grey-box problems by combining accurate glass-box derivatives with local reduced models (RMs) for black-box components. However, existing TR approaches often involve complex multi-layered formulations requiring extensive parameter tuning, or lack open-source implementations. Motivated by the recent advances in funnel-based convergence theory for nonlinear optimisation and the TR filter method, we propose a novel TR funnel algorithm for grey-box optimisation that replaces the filter acceptance criterion with a generalisable uni-dimensional funnel, maintaining a monotonically non-increasing upper bound on approximation error of the local black-box RMs. A global convergence proof to a first-order critical point is established. The algorithm, implemented in an open-source Pyomo framework, supports multiple RM forms and globalisation strategies (filter or funnel). Benchmark tests on seven numerical and engineering problems show that the TR funnel algorithm achieves comparable and often improved performance relative to the classical TR filter method. The TR funnel method thus provides a simpler, and extensible alternative for large-scale grey-box optimisation."}

This allows for a measure of its relative proper motion by comparing the induced GW Doppler shifts between the different images. In addition, if the GW source is in a dynamical environment it will be subject to an acceleration, which will show up as a time dependent Doppler shift in each individual image. In this work we quantify for the first time how a joint detection of these effects can be used to constrain the underlying dynamics and environment of the lensed GW source. We consider a range of different astrophysical environments, from massive clusters to stellar triples, and find that binary black hole (BBH) mergers in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN-disks) are particularly likely to have orbital parameters that can be constrained through our considered lensing setup. Applying these methods to the upcoming catalog of cosmologically strongly lensed GW sources will open up new possibilities for probing their origin and underlying formation mechanisms."}

In this work, we propose a vision-based, markerless, and training-free framework for soft robot shape reconstruction that directly leverages the robot's natural surface appearance. These surface features act as implicit visual markers, enabling a hierarchical matching strategy that decouples local partition alignment from global kinematic optimization. Requiring only an initial 3D reconstruction and kinematic alignment, our method achieves real-time shape tracking across diverse environments while maintaining robustness to occlusions and variations in camera viewpoints. Experimental validation on a continuum soft robot demonstrates an average tip error of 2.6% during real-time operation, as well as stable performance in practical closed-loop control tasks. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach for reliable, low-cost deployment in dynamic real-world settings."}

While at gamma-rays we can not spatially resolve the lensed images, a macrolensing-induced time pattern is expected in the blazar's lightcurve, resulting from the delay between variable gamma-ray components originating from its two brightest lensed images. Compared to our previous study, here we employ high-quality lightcurves coupled with prolonged outburst activity, and improved time-series techniques. Analyzing six independent data segments, we identified a delay of 20.26 +/- 0.62 days (statistical and stochastic uncertainty), with a chance detection probability at the 2.5 x $10^{-5}$ level (post-trial). We also present a novel approach to the magnification ratio estimate based on a comparison with simulated data. Our work suggests that the gamma-ray flux ratio between the two main lens components is $μ_γ \\lesssim$ 1.8. We do not observe convincing evidence of microlensing effects, as previously claimed. The measured gamma-ray time delay is in 2-sigma tension with radio-based estimates, suggesting either distinct emission sites, underestimated radio uncertainties, or gamma-ray production in a region opaque to radio. Our study highlights the potential of well sampled lightcurves and advanced time-series techniques to distinguish true lensing-induced delays from stochastic variability. When combined with improved radio constraints and refined lens models, PKS 1830-211 and similar sources constitute promising systems for time-delay cosmography, offering new insights into both jet structure and cosmological parameters."}

This problem involves finding a path that minimizes a primary cost subject to a budget on a secondary resource. While various RCSPP solvers exist, they often face critical scalability limitations when applied to the large, dense graphs characteristic of complex, real-world scenarios, making them impractical for time-critical planning. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs. APULSE integrates a best-first search guided by an A* heuristic with aggressive, Pulse-style pruning mechanisms and a time-bucketing strategy for effective state-space reduction. A computational study, using a large-scale UGV planning scenario, benchmarks APULSE against state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that APULSE consistently finds near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster and more robust, particularly on large problem instances where competing methods fail. This superior scalability establishes APULSE as an effective solution for RCSPP in complex, large-scale environments, enabling capabilities such as interactive decision support and dynamic replanning."}

However, applying Dreamer to aerial systems has been quite challenging due to its sample inefficiency and poor generalization of dynamics models. Our work explores a physics-informed approach to world model learning and improves policy performance. The world model treats the quadcopter as a free-body system and predicts the net forces and moments acting on it, which are then passed through a 6-DOF Runge-Kutta integrator (RK4) to predict future state rollouts. In this paper, we compare this physics-informed method to a standard RNN-based world model.

Specifically, AIA-UltraNeRF models a continuous function of hash-encoded spatial coordinates for the 3D ultrasound map, allowing for the storage of acoustic impedance without dense sampling. This approach accelerates both reconstruction and inference speeds. We then propose a dual-supervised network that leverages teacher and student models to hash-encode the rendered ultrasound images from the reconstructed map. AIA-UltraNeRF retrieves the most similar hash values without the need to render images again, providing an offline initial image position for localization. Moreover, we develop a RUSS with a spherical remote center of motion mechanism to hold the probe, implementing operator-independent scanning modes that separate image acquisition from diagnostic workflows. Experimental results on a phantom and human subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of acoustic impedance in implicitly characterizing the color of ultrasound images.

A challenge in magnetically manipulating surgical tools is that the effective workspace of an eMNS is often severely constrained by power and thermal limits. We show that system-level control design significantly expands this workspace by reducing the currents needed to achieve a desired motion. We identified five key system approaches that enable this expansion: (i) motion-centric torque/force objectives, (ii) energy-optimal current allocation, (iii) real-time pose estimation, (iv) dynamic feedback, and (v) high-bandwidth eMNS components. As a result, we stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum on an eight-coil OctoMag eMNS with significantly lower currents (0.1-0.2 A vs. 8-14 A), by replacing a field-centric field-alignment strategy with a motion-centric torque/force-based approach. We generalize to multi-agent control by simultaneously stabilizing two inverted pendulums within a shared workspace, exploiting magnetic-field nonlinearity and coil redundancy for independent actuation. A structured analysis compares the electromagnetic workspaces of both paradigms and examines current-allocation strategies that map motion objectives to coil currents. Cross-platform evaluation of the clinically oriented Navion eMNS further demonstrates substantial workspace expansion by maintaining stable balancing at distances up to 50 cm from the coils.

SafeFall is designed to operate seamlessly alongside existing nominal controller, ensuring no interference during normal operation. It combines two synergistic components: a lightweight, GRU-based fall predictor that continuously monitors the robot's state, and a reinforcement learning policy for damage mitigation. The protective policy remains dormant until the predictor identifies a fall as unavoidable, at which point it activates to take control and execute a damage-minimizing response. This policy is trained with a novel, damage-aware reward function that incorporates the robot's specific structural vulnerabilities, learning to shield critical components like the head and hands while absorbing energy with more robust parts of its body.

However, existing methods implement \"least-restrictive\" filtering that discretely switch between nominal and safety policies, potentially undermining the task performance that makes modern visuomotor policies valuable. While reachability value functions can, in principle, be adapted to be control barrier functions (CBFs) for smooth optimization-based filtering, we theoretically and empirically show that current latent-space learning methods produce fundamentally incompatible value functions. We identify two sources of incompatibility: First, in HJ reachability, failures are encoded via a \"margin function\" in latent space, whose sign indicates whether or not a latent is in the constraint set. However, representing the margin function as a classifier yields saturated value functions that exhibit discontinuous jumps. We prove that the value function's Lipschitz constant scales linearly with the margin function's Lipschitz constant, revealing that smooth CBFs require smooth margins. Second, reinforcement learning (RL) approximations trained solely on safety policy data yield inaccurate value estimates for nominal policy actions, precisely where CBF filtering needs them. We propose the LatentCBF, which addresses both challenges through gradient penalties that lead to smooth margin functions without additional labeling, and a value-training procedure that mixes data from both nominal and safety policy distributions. Experiments on simulated benchmarks and hardware with a vision-based manipulation policy demonstrate that LatentCBF enables smooth safety filtering while doubling the task-completion rate over prior switching methods."}

There has been increasing demand to perform this process at the boarding gate to minimise the downtime of the aircraft and automating this process is desired to reduce the reliance on human labour. Automating this typically requires estimating a camera's pose with respect to the aircraft for initialisation but most existing localisation methods require infrastructure, which is very challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments and within the limited turnover time (approximately 2 hours) on an airport tarmac. Additionally, many airlines and airports do not allow contact with the aircraft's surface or using UAVs for inspection between flights, and restrict access to commercial aircraft. Hence, this paper proposes an on-site method that is infrastructure-free and easy to deploy for estimating a pan-tilt-zoom camera's pose and localising scan images. This method initialises using the same pan-tilt-zoom camera used for the inspection task by utilising a Deep Convolutional Neural Network fine-tuned on only synthetic images to predict its own pose. We apply domain randomisation to generate the dataset for fine-tuning the network and modify its loss function by leveraging aircraft geometry to improve accuracy. We also propose a workflow for initialisation, scan path planning, and precise localisation of images captured from a pan-tilt-zoom camera. We evaluate and demonstrate our approach through experiments with real aircraft, achieving root-mean-square camera pose estimation errors of less than 0.24 m and 2 degrees for all real scenes."}

We focus on consensus ADMM as a scalable framework for generating collision-free, dynamically feasible motion plans in both trajectory optimization and receding-horizon control settings. In practice, however, these algorithms are sensitive to penalty tuning or adaptation schemes (e.g. residual balancing and adaptive parameter heuristics) that do not explicitly consider delays. To address this, we introduce a Delay-Aware ADMM (DA-ADMM) variant that adapts penalty parameters based on real-time delay statistics, allowing agents to down-weight stale information and prioritize recent updates during consensus and dual updates. Through extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments with double-integrator, Dubins-car, and drone dynamics, we show that DA-ADMM significantly improves robustness, success rate, and solution quality compared to fixed-parameter, residual-balancing, and fixed-constraint baselines. Our results highlight that performance degradation is not solely determined by delay length or frequency, but by the optimizer's ability to contextually reason over delayed information. The proposed DA-ADMM achieves consistently better coordination performance across a wide range of delay conditions, offering a principled and efficient mechanism for resilient multi-robot motion planning under imperfect communication."}

However, real-time updating of accurate and detail-rich environmental topological maps remains a challenge. This paper presents a topological map updating method based on the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD). First, the newly observed areas are denoised to avoid low-efficiency GVD nodes misleading the topological structure. Subsequently, a multi-granularity hierarchical GVD generation method is designed to control the sampling granularity at both global and local levels. This not only ensures the accuracy of the topological structure but also enhances the ability to capture detail features, reduces the probability of path backtracking, and ensures no overlap between GVDs through the maintenance of a coverage map, thereby improving GVD utilization efficiency. Second, a node clustering method with connectivity constraints and a connectivity method based on a switching mechanism are designed to avoid the generation of unreachable nodes and erroneous nodes caused by obstacle attraction. A special cache structure is used to store all connectivity information, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Finally, to address the issue of frontiers misjudgment caused by obstacles within the scope of GVD units, a frontiers extraction method based on morphological dilation is designed to effectively ensure the reachability of frontiers. On this basis, a lightweight cost function is used to assess and switch to the next viewpoint in real time. This allows the robot to quickly adjust its strategy when signs of path backtracking appear, thereby escaping the predicament and increasing exploration flexibility.

While they perform well when fine-tuned for a single embodiment or task family, extending them to multi-skill settings remains challenging: directly merging VLA experts trained on different tasks results in near-zero success rates. This raises a fundamental question: what prevents VLAs from mastering multiple skills within one model? With an empirical decomposition of learnable parameters during VLA fine-tuning, we identify two key sources of non-mergeability: (1) Finetuning drives LoRA adapters in the VLM backbone toward divergent, task-specific directions beyond the capacity of existing merging methods to unify. (2) Action experts develop inter-block dependencies through self-attention feedback, causing task information to spread across layers and preventing modular recombination. To address these challenges, we present MergeVLA, a merging-oriented VLA architecture that preserves mergeability by design. MergeVLA introduces sparsely activated LoRA adapters via task masks to retain consistent parameters and reduce irreconcilable conflicts in the VLM. Its action expert replaces self-attention with cross-attention-only blocks to keep specialization localized and composable. When the task is unknown, it uses a test-time task router to adaptively select the appropriate task mask and expert head from the initial observation, enabling unsupervised task inference. Across LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, RoboTwin, and multi-task experiments on the real SO101 robotic arm, MergeVLA achieves performance comparable to or even exceeding individually finetuned experts, demonstrating robust generalization across tasks, embodiments, and environments."}

Current approaches face critical limitations: analytical filtering methods suffer from modeling uncertainties and cumulative drift, hybrid learning-filtering approaches remain constrained by their analytical components, while pure learning-based methods struggle with simulation-to-reality transfer and demand extensive real-world data collection. This paper introduces AutoOdom, a novel autoregressive proprioceptive odometry system that overcomes these challenges through an innovative two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 employs large-scale simulation data to learn complex nonlinear dynamics and rapidly changing contact states inherent in legged locomotion, while Stage 2 introduces an autoregressive enhancement mechanism using limited real-world data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. The key innovation lies in our autoregressive training approach, where the model learns from its own predictions to develop resilience against sensor noise and improve robustness in highly dynamic environments. Comprehensive experimental validation on the Booster T1 humanoid robot demonstrates that AutoOdom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation metrics, achieving 57.2% improvement in absolute trajectory error, 59.2% improvement in Umeyama-aligned error, and 36.2% improvement in relative pose error compared to the Legolas baseline.

While prior electroencephalogram (EEG) guided reinforcement learning studies have primarily focused on navigation or low-dimensional locomotion tasks, we aim to understand whether such neural evaluative signals can improve policy learning in high-dimensional manipulation tasks involving obstacles and precise end-effector control. We integrate error related potentials decoded from offline-trained EEG classifiers into reward shaping and systematically evaluate the impact of human-feedback weighting. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based reinforcement learning can scale beyond locomotion tasks and provide a viable pathway for human-aligned manipulation skill acquisition."}

However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach."}

As proven by Earnshaw's theorem, it is not possible to achieve a stable magnetic trap in 3D by static permanent magnets.

The trap is located in an open space with a tunable distance to the magnet array in the range of 20 - 120mm, which is relevant to human anatomical scales. The design is achieved by a novel GPU-accelerated optimization algorithm that uses mean squared error (MSE) and Adam optimizer to efficiently compute the optimal angles for any number of magnets in the array. The algorithm is verified using numerical simulation and physical experiments with an array of two magnets. A millirobot is successfully trapped and controlled to follow a complex trajectory.

We construct a large-scale dataset by tracking human motions in simulation using a pretrained whole body controller, combined with their text annotations. The model directly maps language commands and proprioceptive inputs to low-level actions without any intermediate representation. The model generates action chunks using flow matching, which can be subsequently refined by a residual action head for real-world deployment. Our method exhibits strong semantic understanding and stable execution on humanoid robots in both simulation and real-world deployment, and also supports multi-modal extensions by converting inputs into texts."}

Yet, using it to translate human instructions into an action-resolvable intermediate representation often needs a tradeoff between VLM-comprehensibility and generalizability. Inspired by context-free grammar, we design the Semantic Assembly representation named SEAM, by decomposing the intermediate representation into vocabulary and grammar. Doing so leads us to a concise vocabulary of semantically-rich operations and a VLM-friendly grammar for handling diverse unseen tasks. In addition, we design a new open-vocabulary segmentation paradigm with a retrieval-augmented few-shot learning strategy to localize fine-grained object parts for manipulation, effectively with the shortest inference time over all state-of-the-art parallel works. Also, we formulate new metrics for action-generalizability and VLM-comprehensibility, demonstrating the compelling performance of SEAM over mainstream representations on both aspects. Extensive real-world experiments further manifest its SOTA performance under varying settings and tasks."}

The thesis introduces a new Triple Scissors Deployable Truss Mechanism (TSDTM) for space antenna missions. The new mechanism is to be stowed during launch and efficiently deploy in orbit, offering maximum aperture size while taking up minimal launch volume. The thesis covers the entire design process from geometric modeling, kinematic analysis with screw theory and Newtonian approaches, dynamic analysis by eigenvalue and simulation methods, and verification with SolidWorks. In addition, optimization routines were coded based on Support Vector Machines for material choice in LEO environments and machine learning method for geometric setup. The TSDTM presented has enhanced structural dynamics with good comparison between simulation and analytical predictions. The structure optimized proved highly accurate, with a deviation of just 1.94% between machine learning-predicted and simulated natural frequencies, demonstrating the potential of incorporating AI-based methods in space structural design."}

Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.
