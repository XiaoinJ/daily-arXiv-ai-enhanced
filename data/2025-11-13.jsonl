In power systems modeling, the use of alternative solutions has been limited to energy system optimization modeling (ESOM) applications and modeling to generate alternative (MGA) techniques. We present three key results about alternative solutions for power systems modeling. First, we give a perspective, based on sublevel sets and projection, for characterizing alternative solutions as a facet of general optimization theory. Second, we include pointers to alternative solution generation methods and tools beyond MGA-style techniques. Third, we demonstrate the use cases for alternative solutions in power system modeling on the fundamental optimal power flow problem."}

In this work, we formulate the inverse problem of causal inference within the framework of group-representation theory, clarifying the structure of the representation spaces to which the {\\it causality} and estimation maps belong. This formulation leads to both theoretical and practical limits of reconstructability (identifiability). We show that the local velocity-gradient tensor, regarded as a {\\it causal factor}, can be reconstructed from the orientational motion of suspended particles. In this setting, the estimation map must act as a group homomorphism between the observation and causal spaces, and the reconstructable subspace is constrained by the decomposition structure of the SO(3) representation. Based on this principle, we construct an SO(3)-equivariant neural network (implemented with the e3nn framework) and verify that the identifiability determined by the group-representation structure is reproduced in the actual learning process. These results demonstrate a fundamental principle that the group-representation structure determines the reconstructability (identifiability limit) in inverse problems of causal inference."}

Nonlinearities are modeled using incremental quadratic constraints, including Lipschitz, L-smooth, and sector-bounded nonlinearities. Funnel invariance is ensured via a DLMI. Together with pointwise-in-time LMIs for state and input constraints, we formulate a continuous-time funnel synthesis problem. To solve it using numerical optimal control techniques, the DLMI is reformulated into a differential matrix equality (DME) and an LMI, where the DME acts as a funnel dynamics equation. We explore different formulations of these funnel dynamics. Continuous-time constraint satisfaction is addressed through two convex methods: one based on intermediate constraint-checking points, and another using a successive convexification method with subgradients to handle nondifferentiable maximum eigenvalue functions. Theoretical justification is provided for the existence of a measurable and integrable subgradient for the latter. The method is demonstrated on two numerical examples: the control of a unicycle and a 6-degree-of-freedom quadrotor for obstacle avoidance."}

Using the operator separation of variables method and the WKB-ansatz, we obtain single-mode equations describing the evolution of amplitude and phase along rays. The approach incorporates non-self-adjoint operators to model energy leakage through the bottom and introduces a Hamiltonian formalism for eikonal and transport equations, enabling the computation of amplitude, time, and phase fronts. Analytical and numerical examples are provided for different boundary conditions, including Neumann (ideal), self-adjoint, and partially reflecting interfaces. The results extend previous semiclassical and ray-based theories of wave propagation by including dissipative effects and improving the physical realism of shallow-water acoustic modeling."}

To do this, we develop for the first time a description of a relativistic hydrodynamic-like theory using $k$-contact geometry. In this approach, thermodynamic laws are encoded in a $k$-contact form, thermodynamical states are described via $k$-contact Legendrian submanifolds, and conservation laws emerge as a consequence of Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl (HdDW) equations. The inherent non-uniqueness of these solutions is identified as the source of the pseudo-gauge freedom. We explicitly demonstrate how this redefinition of equilibrium works in a model of a Bjorken-like expansion, where a pseudo-gauge transformation is shown to leave the physical dissipation invariant."}

These problems can be reformulated as McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) in a random environment, where the coefficients depend on the conditional law of the state given the common noise. Existing numerical methods, however, are largely limited to cases where interactions depend only on expectations or low-order moments, and therefore cannot address the general setting of full distributional dependence.\n  In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based algorithm for solving MV-FBSDEs with common noise and general mean-field interactions. Building on fictitious play, our method iteratively solves conditional FBSDEs with fixed distributions, where the conditional law is efficiently represented using signatures, and then updates the distribution through supervised learning. Deep neural networks are employed both to solve the conditional FBSDEs and to approximate the distribution-dependent coefficients, enabling scalability to high-dimensional problems. Under suitable assumptions, we establish convergence in terms of the fictitious play iterations, with error controlled by the supervised learning step. Numerical experiments, including a distribution-dependent mean-field game with common noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

Each part is tackled by the solver that suits it best-branch and cut for the MIP subproblem, first-order optimisation for the NN subproblem-so the model remains modular, the number of integer variables never grows with network depth, and the per-iteration cost scales only linearly with the NN size. On the public \\textsc{SurrogateLIB} benchmark, our method proves \\textbf{scalable}, \\textbf{modular}, and \\textbf{adaptable}: it runs \\(120\\times\\) faster than an exact Big-M formulation on the largest test case; the NN sub-solver can be swapped from a log-barrier interior step to a projected-gradient routine with no code changes and identical objective value; and swapping the MLP for an LSTM backbone still completes the full optimisation in 47s without any bespoke adaptation."}

Rather than minimizing residual error for fixed or perturbed data, we interpret least-squares as enforcing approximate subspace inclusion between measured and true data spaces. The uncertainty in this geometric relation is modeled as a metric ball on the Grassmannian manifold, leading to a min-max problem over Euclidean and manifold variables. The inner maximization admits a closed-form solution, enabling an efficient algorithm with a transparent geometric interpretation. Applied to robust finite-horizon linear-quadratic tracking in data-enabled predictive control, the method improves upon existing robust least-squares formulations, achieving stronger robustness and favorable scaling under small uncertainty."}

At the upper layer, optimal PSES siting and network topology decisions are made to minimize total investment and operational costs. The middle-layer formulation tackles worst case uncertainty scenarios via the optimal power flow model, utilizing ambiguity sets to capture correlated uncertainties. To handle non-convexities introduced by binary variables for energy storage systems, we propose and rigorously prove the exactness of a novel relaxation approach. At the lower layer, considering the dynamic pricing driven by tidal energy fluctuations, operational decisions-including electricity procurement and carbon emissions are optimized. An inexact column-and-constraint generation (i-CCG) algorithm is developed for efficient problem-solving.

We assume that this distribution has a bounded and non-increasing density, which is natural since this holds for the law of the excess time in any stationary renewal process.
