This method is inspired by non-stationary Particle methods, the time variable being replaced by one spatial variable. Particles trajectories are computed using the ``time-dependent'' equations, and then the approximation is based on a quadrature method using the particle locations as quadrature points. We prove the convergence of the scheme under suitable regularity assumptions on the data and the solution, together with a ``characteristic completeness'' assumption (the characteristic curves fullfill the whole computational domain). We also provide an error estimate. The scheme is tested numerically on a two dimensional linear equation and we present a numerical study of convergence. Finally, we use this method to carry out numerical simulations of a landscape evolution model, where an erodible topography evolves under the effects of water erosion and sedimentation. The scheme is then useful to deal with wet/dry areas."}

For a parameter $1 \\le p \\le r$, $A_p := \\sum_{i=1}^p σ_i u_i v_i^\\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase \"low-rank approximation\". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank. This assumption is frequently met in practice, and we think that this case deserves a separate, accessible treatment."}

In this paper, we study the time-resolved signal expected from such early shocks. An internal collision is modeled using a 1D special relativistic hydrodynamical simulation and the photon distributions in the resulting forward and reverse shocks, as well as in the common downstream region, are followed to well above the photosphere using a designated RMS simulation code. The light curve and time resolved spectrum of the resulting single pulse is computed taking into account the emission at different optical depths and angles to the line-of-sight. For the specific case considered, we find a light curve consisting of a short pulse lasting $\\sim 0.1$ s for an assumed redshift of $z = 1$. The efficiency is large, with $\\approx 23$% of the total burst energy being radiated. The spectrum has a complex shape at very early times, after which it settles into a more generic shape with a smooth curvature below the peak energy, $E_p$, and a clear high-energy power law that cuts off at $\\sim 5$ MeV in the observer frame. The spectrum becomes narrower and softer at late times with $E_p$ steadily decreasing during the pulse decay from $E_p \\approx 250~$keV to $E_p \\approx 100$ keV. The low-energy index, $α$, decreases during the bright part of the pulse from $α\\approx -0.5$ to $α\\approx -1$, although the low-energy part is better fit with a broken power law when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The high-energy power law is generated by the reverse shock at low optical depths ($τ< 30$) and has an index that decreases from $β\\approx -2$ to $β\\approx -2.4$.

Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\\nabla T_y / \\nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios."}

Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice."}

To solve it using numerical optimal control techniques, the DLMI is reformulated into a differential matrix equality (DME) and an LMI, where the DME acts as a funnel dynamics equation. We explore different formulations of these funnel dynamics. Continuous-time constraint satisfaction is addressed through two convex methods: one based on intermediate constraint-checking points, and another using a successive convexification method with subgradients to handle nondifferentiable maximum eigenvalue functions. Theoretical justification is provided for the existence of a measurable and integrable subgradient for the latter. The method is demonstrated on two numerical examples: the control of a unicycle and a 6-degree-of-freedom quadrotor for obstacle avoidance."}

Currently, scalable metrics for measuring aspirations are limited. This study adapts, translates, and evaluates Snyder's Hope Scale as a metric for measuring aspirations among 136 women learning programming online during a period of systemic educational restrictions in Afghanistan. The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant. While overall aspiration-related scores did not differ significantly by access to Large Language Models (LLMs), those with access reported marginally higher scores on the Avenues subscale (p = .056), suggesting broader perceived pathways to achieving educational aspirations. These findings support the use of the adapted scale as a metric for aspirations in contexts of socio-political instability.

The approach incorporates a judgment condition to ensure the problem's well-posedness and computes a lower-degree Newton-type interpolation basis (which is also a strongly proper interpolation basis) along with the corresponding interpolation polynomial.

A widely accepted hypothesis is that these spatial patterns are correlated with morphology of the cells and their nuclei. Nevertheless, tools to quantify the correlation, with uncertainty, are scarce, and the state-of-the-art is based on low-dimensional numerical summaries of the shapes that are inadequate to fully encode shape information. To this end, we propose a marked point process framework to assess spatial correlation among shapes of planar closed curves, which represent cell or nuclei outlines. With shapes of curves as marks, the framework is based on a mark-weighted $K$ function, a second-order spatial statistic that accounts for the marks' variation by using test functions that capture only the shapes of cells and their nuclei. We then develop local and global hypothesis tests for spatial dependence between the marks using the $K$ function. The framework is brought to bear on the cell nuclei extracted from histopathology images of breast cancer, where we uncover distinct correlation patterns that are consistent with clinical expectations."}

In this approach, thermodynamic laws are encoded in a $k$-contact form, thermodynamical states are described via $k$-contact Legendrian submanifolds, and conservation laws emerge as a consequence of Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl (HdDW) equations. The inherent non-uniqueness of these solutions is identified as the source of the pseudo-gauge freedom.

[Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed."}

These problems can be reformulated as McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) in a random environment, where the coefficients depend on the conditional law of the state given the common noise. Existing numerical methods, however, are largely limited to cases where interactions depend only on expectations or low-order moments, and therefore cannot address the general setting of full distributional dependence.\n  In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based algorithm for solving MV-FBSDEs with common noise and general mean-field interactions. Building on fictitious play, our method iteratively solves conditional FBSDEs with fixed distributions, where the conditional law is efficiently represented using signatures, and then updates the distribution through supervised learning. Deep neural networks are employed both to solve the conditional FBSDEs and to approximate the distribution-dependent coefficients, enabling scalability to high-dimensional problems. Under suitable assumptions, we establish convergence in terms of the fictitious play iterations, with error controlled by the supervised learning step. Numerical experiments, including a distribution-dependent mean-field game with common noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

The Expected Threat model has been praised for its explainability and offers an accessible option. However, selecting the grid size is a challenging key design choice that has to be made when applying the Expected Threat model. Using a finer grid leads to a more flexible model that can better distinguish between different situations, but the accuracy of the estimates deteriorates with a more flexible model. Consequently, practitioners face challenges in balancing the trade-off between model flexibility and model accuracy. In this study, the Expected Threat model is analyzed from a theoretical perspective and simulations are performed based on the Markov chain of the model to examine its behavior in practice. Our theoretical results establish an upper bound on the error of the Expected Threat model for different flexibilities. Based on the simulations, a more accurate characterization of the model's error is provided, improving over the theoretical bound. Finally, these insights are converted into a practical rule of thumb to help practitioners choose the right balance between the model flexibility and the desired accuracy of the Expected Threat model."}

We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem."}

Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars.

To obtain finite-dimensional spaces, it is necessary to introduce a truncation boundary, whereby only a bounded computational subdomain is meshed, leading to an approximation of the solution by zero in the remainder of the domain. We propose a residual-based error estimator that accounts for both the standard discretization error as well as the effect of the truncation boundary. This estimator is shown to be reliable and efficient under appropriate assumptions on the triangulation. Based on this estimator, we devise an adaptive algorithm that automatically refines the mesh and pushes the truncation boundary towards infinity. We prove that this algorithm converges and even achieves optimal rates in terms of the number of degrees of freedom. We finally provide numerical examples illustrating our key theoretical findings."}

Gravitational waves affect the path of radio pulses propagating from a pulsar to Earth, causing the arrival times of those pulses to deviate from expectations based on the physical characteristics of the pulsar system. By correlating these timing residuals in a pulsar timing array (PTA), one can search for a statistically isotropic background of gravitational waves by revealing evidence for a distinctive pattern predicted by General Relativity, known as the Hellings \\& Downs curve. On June 29 2023, five regional PTA collaborations announced the first evidence for GWs at light-year wavelengths, predicated on support for this correlation pattern with statistical significances ranging from $\\sim\\!2-4σ$. The amplitude and shape of the recovered GW spectrum has also allowed many investigations of the expected source characteristics, ranging from a cosmic population of supermassive binary black holes to numerous processes in the early Universe. In the future, we expect to resolve signals from individual binary systems of supermassive black holes, and probe fundamental assumptions about the background, including its polarization, anisotropy, Gaussianity, and stationarity, all of which will aid efforts to discriminate its origin. In tandem with new facilities like DSA-2000 and the SKA, fueling further observations by regional PTAs and the International Pulsar Timing Array, PTAs have extraordinary potential to be engines of nanohertz GW discovery."}

To propagate these uncertainties and convey their influence on the performance of the engineering system, a high-dimensional design space is supposed to be explored. A great challenge to be considered here lies in the computational burden as conducting such an exploration campaign requires substantial calls to computationally expensive finite element simulations. To address this challenge, a surrogate model mapping the design space to the reinforced concrete bridge performance functions is developed in the context of an active learning algorithm. The importance of this model lies in its ability to explore as many design scenarios as possible with minimal computational resources and classify the design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios. This work considers a 4-span reinforced concrete bridge deck. A multi-fiber finite element model of this beam is developed in Cast3m to generate the required design of experiments for the surrogate model. A performance comparison is undertaken to evaluate the Kriging surrogate model effectiveness with and without active learning while the reliability of Kriging predictions is also assessed in comparison to PC-Kriging."}

To investigate the underlying emission mechanisms, we performed a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis using multiwavelength data from \\textit{Swift}-XRT/UVOT and \\textit{Fermi}-LAT, covering the optical/UV to GeV $γ$-ray bands. The source shows strong energy-dependent variability, with the largest fractional variability in $γ$-rays, followed by X-rays and UV/optical, consistent with leptonic emission scenarios. Based on the variability patterns, we identified distinct flux states (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, VHE-FX1, and VHE-FX2). The X-ray spectra exhibit a clear ``harder-when-brighter'' trend across these states. We modeled the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using a one-zone model incorporating synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission, implemented in \\textsc{xspec} using $χ^{2}$ minimization. During the VHE detection, the corresponding X-ray/optical emission likely resembled the F2 state. Modeling the VHE SED using F1-state data led to an SSC overprediction of the VHE flux, whereas all other states were well described within the one-zone framework. Systematic trends in physical parameters are observed across flux states, including spectral hardening, increasing break energy, rising bulk Lorentz factor, and decreasing magnetic field with increasing flux. These results suggest that enhanced particle acceleration efficiency and stronger Doppler boosting drive the observed flaring activity, while the decrease in magnetic field indicates conversion of magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy, consistent with shock-driven scenarios."}

The inner maximization admits a closed-form solution, enabling an efficient algorithm with a transparent geometric interpretation. Applied to robust finite-horizon linear-quadratic tracking in data-enabled predictive control, the method improves upon existing robust least-squares formulations, achieving stronger robustness and favorable scaling under small uncertainty."}

These efforts often operationalize justice at the upper and lower bounds of its continuum, defining it in terms of progressiveness or reform. Before characterizing the type of justice an AI tool should have baked in, we argue for a systematic discovery of how justice is executed by the recipient system: a method the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) framework terms Value Source analysis. The present work asks: how is justice operationalized within current child welfare administrative policy and what does it teach us about how to develop AI? We conduct a mixed-methods analysis of child welfare policy in the state of New York and find a range of functional definitions of justice (which we term principles). These principles reflect more nuanced understandings of justice across a spectrum of contexts: from established concepts like fairness and equity to less common foci like the proprietary rights of parents and children. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between AI and policy, highlighting the importance of operationalized values in adjudicating our development of ethical design requirements for high stakes decision settings."}

Suites of N-body simulations reveal possible outcomes of binary capture and merger, mean-motion resonance interactions, and other novel dynamical pathways. We develop analytical models linking the branching ratios of captures and mergers to local disc properties, applicable to black hole populations across all mass ratios.

While first-order total variation (TV) regularization effectively preserves edges, it often introduces staircase artifacts, whereas higher-order TV removes such artifacts but oversmooths fine details. To reconcile these competing effects, we propose a semi-convergent stage-wise framework that sequentially integrates first- and higher-order TV regularizers within an iterative restoration process implemented via ADMM. Each stage exhibits semi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iterates initially approach the ground truth before being degraded by over-regularization. By monitoring this evolution, the algorithm adaptively selects the locally optimal iterate (e.g., with the highest PSNR) and propagates it as the initial point for the next stage. This select-and-propagate mechanism effectively transfers local semi-convergence into a globally convergent iterative process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the sequence of stage-wise iterates is bounded, the objective values decrease monotonically. Extensive numerical experiments on denoising and deblurring benchmarks confirm that the proposed method achieves superior quantitative and perceptual performance compared with conventional first-, higher-order, hybrid TV methods, and learning based methods, while maintaining theoretical interpretability and algorithmic simplicity."}

Further analysis of the PKS J1309+1154 light curve provides compelling evidence that both the fundamental and the harmonic are real, confirming the existence of real periodicities in blazar light curves. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of watertight evidence for a fundamental and a harmonic periodicity in a blazar light curve. It makes PKS J1309+1154 a \\textit{strong\\/} supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidate, and thus the third such candidate to be revealed through long-term radio monitoring, the other two being PKS J0805--0111 and PKS 2131--021, both discovered through the OVRO 40 m Telescope monitoring program. It is argued that hundreds of SMBHB candidates will be discovered by the Vera Rubin and Simons Observatories. Coherent searches for gravitational waves from a network of SMBHB candidates, starting immediately, are strongly motivated."}

Our formulation yields a data-driven convex optimization problem where a prosumer community agrees on a contract with the PLM for the provision of storage services over a finite horizon. Leveraging recent results in the scenario approach, we certify out-of-sample constraint safety. Furthermore, we enable a tunable profit-risk trade-off through scenario relaxation and extend our model to account for robustness to adversarial perturbations and distributional shifts over Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets. All the approaches are accompanied by tight finite-sample certificates. Numerical studies demonstrate the out-of-sample and out-of-distribution constraint satisfaction of our proposed model compared to the developed theoretical guarantees, showing their effectiveness and potential in robust and efficient virtual energy services."}

The method is proved to be uniquely solvable on general nonuniform grids for $α\\in(0,1)$, provided that the sum-of-exponentials (SOE) approximation is sufficiently accurate. In addition, a modified scheme is developed and proved to be uniquely solvable on uniform grids for $α\\in(0,2)$. Efficient implementation of the proposed fast collocation schemes based on fast matrix-vector multiplication is carefully discussed, in terms of computational complexity and memory requirement. To further improve computational efficiency, a banded preconditioner is incorporated into the Krylov subspace iterative solver. A rigorous maximum-norm error analysis for $α\\in(0,1)$ is presented on specific graded grids, which shows that the convergence order depends on the grading parameter. Numerical experiments validate the predicted convergence and demonstrate the efficiency of the fast collocation schemes."}

To model the spectral energy distribution of these new sources, we apply the hybrid shock-turbulence acceleration framework previously developed for extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs. We present three representative realizations that produce synchrotron peaks between $0.2$ and $2$ MeV and evaluate their multiwavelenght signatures. Our results show that UEHBLs would be undetectable with current GeV (Fermi) and future TeV (CTA) facilities due to severe Klein-Nishina suppression of inverse Compton scattering, but are ideal targets for proposed MeV missions such as COSI, AMEGO-X, and e-ASTROGAM. We further identify a sample of hard X-ray sources from the Swift-BAT catalogs that exhibit the expected spectral properties of UEHBLs, potentially representing the first observational hints of this population. If confirmed, UEHBLs would provide unique insight into particle acceleration in relativistic jets, imposing strong constraints on the maximum achievable electron energies. We also discuss the expected polarization and variability signatures, including the possibility of synchrotron-driven thermal instabilities leading to MeV flares. These findings underscore the critical importance of the MeV band for discovering and characterizing the most extreme accelerators among blazars."}

The problem incorporates simple constraints on maximum speed, acceleration and braking rates, and depends on the assumed distribution of the remaining time until the traffic light will turn green, after it is first noticed. We assume that this distribution has a bounded and non-increasing density, which is natural since this holds for the law of the excess time in any stationary renewal process. In two special cases, where this distribution is either Uniform or Exponential, we give a complete characterisation of all possible combinations of phases of maximum acceleration, maximum speed, maximum braking, following an Euler--Lagrange curve, and standing stationary at the traffic light, which can make up an optimal solution. The key technique is to write the problem in terms of a two-dimensional pressure integral, so that the problem becomes analogous to filling a tank with a given quantity of liquid."}

Our objective is to resolve the computational challenges associated with triple integration by transforming it into an initial value problem. Euler's method is the fundamental numerical technique for approximating the solution, thereby establishing a baseline for accuracy. The precision of our computations is subsequently improved by employing Richardson's extrapolation to reduce errors systematically. This approach not only illustrates the adaptability of numerical methods in solving intricate mathematical problems, but it also emphasizes the significance of strategic error reduction techniques in enhancing computational outcomes. We present the efficacy of this method in solving triple integrals in an efficient manner through experimentation and analysis, thereby making a significant contribution to the fields of numerical computation and mathematical modeling."}

For a parameter $1 \\le p \\le r$, $A_p := \\sum_{i=1}^p σ_i u_i v_i^\\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase \"low-rank approximation\". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank. This assumption is frequently met in practice, and we think that this case deserves a separate, accessible treatment."}
