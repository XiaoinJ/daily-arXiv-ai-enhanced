We focus first on the case of self-chromatic symmetric functions (self-CSFs) $X_G^G$, making some progress toward a conjecture from (arXiv:2011.06063) that the self-CSF, like the normal CSF, is always different for different trees. In particular, we show that the self-CSF distinguishes trees from non-trees with just one exception, we check using Sage that it distinguishes all trees on up to 12 vertices, and we show that it determines the number of legs of a spider and the degree sequence of a caterpillar given its spine length. We also show that the self-CSF detects the number of connected components of a forest, again with just one exception.

Given $E\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_q^d$ or $E\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$, finding lower bounds on the VC-dimension of hypothesis classes defined by geometric objects such as spheres and hyperplanes is equivalent to constructing appropriate geometric configurations in $E$. The complexity of these configurations increases exponentially with the VC-dimension.\n  These questions are related to the Erdős distance problem and the Falconer problem when considering a hypothesis class defined by spheres. In particular, the Erdős distance problem over finite fields is equivalent to showing that the VC-dimension of translates of a sphere of radius $t$ is at least one for all nonzero $t\\in \\mathbb{F}_q$.

To complement this, Bultena and Ruskey considered $n$-Venn diagrams that minimize the number of crossings, which implies that many curves intersect in every crossing.

We completely solve these problems in all degrees over all global, local and finite fields and provide new solutions of the inverse Galois problem in characteristic 2. Our results generalise well-known theorems on cubic surfaces."}

Given $E\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_q^d$ or $E\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$, finding lower bounds on the VC-dimension of hypothesis classes defined by geometric objects such as spheres and hyperplanes is equivalent to constructing appropriate geometric configurations in $E$. The complexity of these configurations increases exponentially with the VC-dimension.\n  These questions are related to the Erdős distance problem and the Falconer problem when considering a hypothesis class defined by spheres. In particular, the Erdős distance problem over finite fields is equivalent to showing that the VC-dimension of translates of a sphere of radius $t$ is at least one for all nonzero $t\\in \\mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we show that many of the existing techniques for distance problems over finite fields can be extended to a much broader context, not relying on the specific geometry of circles and spheres. We provide a unified framework which allows us to simultaneously study highly structured sets such as algebraic curves, as well as random sets."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "In this article, we prove various results about six-functor formalisms and morphisms between them. In particular, we show that the stable motivic homotopy theory of algebraic stacks is the universal six-functor functor formalism in a strong sense: it is initial in some category whose objects are six-functor formalisms, and whose morphisms commute with the six operations. This strengthens previous results of this form, which only showed that stable motivic homotopy theory is a six-functor formalism, and is initial, but not that the morphisms from it commute with the six operations.\n  We also prove a similar result for the stable motivic homotopy theory of complex analytic stacks, and produce a Betti realization for stacks that commutes with Grothendieck's six operations, generalizing previous results of Ayoub for quasi-projective schemes.\n  In order to do this, we give a generalized and enhanced account of Voevodsky's geometric criterion for six-functor formalisms. Our version of Voevodsky's principle makes sense in more general geometric contexts (not only algebraic geometry), and also provides a criterion for showing that a morphism between six-functor formalisms is compatible with the six operations."}
