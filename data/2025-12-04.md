Abstract: Tom Leinster gave a bijective correspondence between the set of operators on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ and the set of pairs consisting of a nilpotent operator and a vector in $V$. Over a finite field this bijection implies that the probability that an operator be nilpotent is the reciprocal of the number of vectors in $V$. We generalize this correspondence to pairs of operators between pairs of vector spaces and determine the probability that a random pair of operators be nilpotent. We also determine the set-theoretical counterpart of this construction and compute the number of eventually constant pairs of maps between two finite sets, closely related to the number of spanning trees in a complete bipartite graph.

Abstract: We construct left and right Calabi-Yau structures on derived respectively singularity categories of symmetric orders $Λ$ over commutative Gorenstein rings $R$. For this, we first construct Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ by lifting Amiot's construction of Calabi-Yau structures on Verdier quotients to the dg level. Then we prove base change properties relating Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ to those over the base field $k$. As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $Λ$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $Λ$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $Λ$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot.

Abstract: An insider is defined as a team member who covertly deviates from the team's optimal collaborative control strategy in pursuit of a private objective, while maintaining an outward appearance of cooperation. Such insider threats can severely undermine cooperative systems: subtle deviations may degrade collective performance, jeopardize mission success, and compromise operational safety. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for identifying and mitigating insider threats in cooperative control settings. We introduce an insider-aware, game-theoretic formulation in which the insider's hidden intention is parameterized, allowing the threat identification task to be reformulated as a parameter estimation problem. To address this challenge, we employ an online indirect dual adaptive control approach that simultaneously infers the insider's control strategy and counteracts its negative influence. By injecting properly designed probing signals, the resulting mitigation policy asymptotically recovers the nominal optimal control law - one that would be achieved under full knowledge of the insider's objective. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed identification-mitigation framework and illustrate its capability to preserve team performance even in the presence of covert adversarial behavior.

Abstract: This paper considers a bilevel program. To solve this bilevel program, it is generally necessary to transform it into some single-level optimization problem. One approach is to replace the lower-level program by its KKT conditions to transform the bilevel program as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). Another approach is to apply the lower-level Wolfe/Mond-Weir/extended Mond-Weir duality to transform the bilevel program into some duality-based single-level reformulations, called WDP, MDP, and eMDP respectively in the literature. In this paper, inspired by a conjecture from a recent publication that the tighter feasible region of a reformulation, the better its numerical performance, we present three new duality-based single-level reformulations, called TWDP/TMDP/eTMDP, with tighter feasible regions. Our main goal is to compare all above-mentioned reformulations by designing some direct and relaxation algorithms with projection and implementing these algorithms on 450 test examples generated randomly. Our numerical experiments show that, whether overall comparison or pairwise comparison, at least in our tests, the WDP/MDP/TWDP/TMDP reformulations were always better than the MPCC reformulation, while the eMDP/eTMDP reformulations were always the worst ones among six duality-based reformulations, which indicates that the above conjecture is incorrect. In particular, for the relaxation algorithms, the WDP/MDP/TWDP/TMDP reformulations performed 3-5 times better than the MPCC reformulation, while the eMDP/eTMDP reformulations performed 2 times better than the MPCC reformulation.

Abstract: A strategy for reducing the number of iterations and computational burden in shrinking horizon Model Predictive Control (SH-MPC) when steering into a prescribed terminal set despite unmeasured disturbances is proposed. This strategy exploits dynamic adjustment of the terminal cost weight and horizon length while ensuring that the terminal set is reached within a desired number of steps. A lower Hessian condition number which facilitates the computational reduction is proved under assumptions, and an example of spacecraft nutation damping using the proposed approach is reported.

Abstract: We study the dynamics and equilibria of a new kind of routing games, where players - drivers of future autonomous vehicles - may switch between individual (HDV) and collective (CAV) routing. In individual routing, just like today, drivers select routes minimizing expected travel costs, whereas in collective routing an operator centrally assigns vehicles to routes. The utility is then the average experienced travel time discounted with individually perceived attractiveness of automated driving. The market share maximising strategy amounts to offering utility greater than for individual routing to as many drivers as possible. Our theoretical contribution consists in developing a rigorous mathematical framework of individualized collective routing and studying algorithms which fleets of CAVs may use for their market-share optimization. We also define bi-level CAV - HDV equilibria and derive conditions which link the potential marketing behaviour of CAVs to the behavioural profile of the human population. Practically, we find that the fleet operator may often be able to equilibrate at full market share by simply mimicking the choices HDVs would make. In more realistic heterogenous human population settings, however, we discover that the market-share maximizing fleet controller should use highly variable mixed strategies as a means to attract or retain customers. The reason is that in mixed routing the powerful group player can control which vehicles are routed via congested and uncongested alternatives. The congestion pattern generated by CAVs is, however, not known to HDVs before departure and so HDVs cannot select faster routes and face huge uncertainty whichever alternative they choose. Consequently, mixed market-share maximising fleet strategies resulting in unpredictable day-to-day driving conditions may, alarmingly, become pervasive in our future cities.

Abstract: This paper studies open-loop and feedback solutions to leader-follower mean field linear-quadratic-Gaussian games with multiplicative noise by the direct approach. The leader-follower game involves a leader and many followers, where the state and control weight matrices in their costs are not limited to be positive definite. From variational analysis with mean field approximations, we obtain a set of open-loop controls in terms of solutions to mean field forward-backward stochastic differential equations. By applying the matrix maximum principle, a set of decentralized feedback strategies is constructed. Distinct from traditional works, a cross term has appeared in derivation due to the presence of mean field terms. For open-loop and feedback solutions, the corresponding optimal costs of all players are explicitly given in terms of the solutions to two Riccati equations, respectively.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical architecture for efficiently computing high-quality solutions to structured mixed-integer programs (MIPs). To reduce computational effort, our approach decouples the original problem into a higher level problem and a lower level problem, both of smaller size. We solve both problems sequentially, where decisions of the higher level problem become parameters of the constraints of the lower level problem. We formulate this learning task as a convex optimization problem using decision-focused learning techniques and solve it by differentiating through the higher and the lower level problems in our architecture. To ensure robustness, we derive out-of-sample performance guarantees using conformal prediction. Numerical experiments in facility location, knapsack problems, and vehicle routing problems demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces computation time while maintaining feasibility and high solution quality compared to state-of-the-art solvers.

Abstract: Sequential convex programming has been established as an effective framework for solving nonconvex trajectory planning problems. However, its performance is highly sensitive to problem parameters, including trajectory variables, algorithmic hyperparameters, and physical vehicle parameters. This paper introduces a differentiable sequential convex programming framework that integrates differentiable convex optimization with sequential convex programming to enable end-to-end parameter optimization. By deriving first-order sensitivity relations of second-order cone programming solutions with respect to problem data, exact gradients of trajectory performance metrics with respect to arbitrary parameters are obtained and propagated through iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through three representative applications: optimal terminal-time prediction for powered landing, trust-region penalty optimization in subproblems, and surface-to-mass ratio optimization for hypersonic gliding vehicles. Simulation results show that the proposed framework enables reliable gradient-based parameter learning and significantly improves numerical performance, convergence behavior, and design efficiency. These results indicate that differentiable sequential convex programming framework provides a powerful and general tool for vehicle design, mission optimization, and hyperparameter selection in aerospace trajectory planning.

Abstract: Integrating demand-responsive mobility services with transit systems is recognized as a practical and effective strategy to mitigate their impact on traffic congestion and the environment. This study develops an efficient hybrid metaheuristic to solve the integrated dial-a-ride problem by utilizing electric vehicles to minimize operational costs and customer travel time. Customer transfer inconvenience is restricted by a maximum intermodal transfer time to synchronize demand-responsive buses' arrival and transit departures. The proposed metaheuristic addresses the challenges of integrating demand-responsive vehicle routing and charging operations with fixed-route transit systems with capacitated charging stations and partial recharge. We benchmarked our algorithm against a state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming solver on instances with 10-50 customers and two transit lines. Our approach achieves solutions that are, on average, 23.8% better in solution quality within around 2 minutes, outperforming those obtained by the solver using an 8-hour computational time limit. We evaluate the impact of various system parameters to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The results suggest that, from the operator's perspective, while the integrated dial-a-ride service reduces vehicle kilometers traveled, the used fleet size may not necessarily be reduced when ensuring high-quality service for passengers. Moreover, operating the integrated systems is more beneficial in areas with dense transit networks, compared with increases in transit frequency. The findings provide valuable insights for developing integrated dial-a-ride services in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we design a risk-averse controller for an interconnected system composed of a linear Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) actuated through a linear parabolic heat equation. These dynamics arise in various applications, such as coupled heat transfer systems and chemical reaction processes that are subject to disturbances. While existing optimal control methods for these systems focus on minimizing average performance, this risk-neutral perspective may allow rare but highly undesirable system behaviors. To account for such events, we instead minimize the cost within a coherent risk measure. Our approach reformulates the coupled dynamics as a stochastic PDE, approximates it by a finite-dimensional SDE system, and applies a gradient-based method to compute a riskaverse feedback controller. Numerical simulations show that the proposed controller substantially reduces the tail of the cost distribution, improving reliability with only a minor reduction in average performance.

Abstract: We propose a SCHMM LMPC framework, integrating Semi Continuous Hidden Markov Models with Lyapunov based Model Predictive Control, for distributed optimal control of multi agent systems under network imperfections. The SCHMM captures the stochastic network behavior in real time, while LMPC ensures consensus and optimality via Linear Matrix Inequalities LMIs. The developed optimal control problem simultaneously minimizes three elements. First, the control effort is reduced to avoid aggressive inputs and second, the network induced error caused by time delays and packet dropouts. Third, the topology-induced error, as the distributed graph restricts agents access to global information. This error is inherent to the communication graph and cannot be addressed through offline learning. To overcome this, the study also introduces the incremental Expectation Maximization EM algorithm, enabling online learning of the SCHMM. This adaptation allows the framework to mitigate both network and topology errors while maintaining optimality through MPC. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCHMM LMPC, demonstrating adaptability in multi agent systems with diverse topologies.

Abstract: Let $M$ be a complete connected Riemannian manifold. For $n \geq 0$, we endow the Wasserstein space $P^{(n)}_2(M) = P_2(\ldots P_2(M)\ldots)$, equipped with the Wasserstein distance $W_2$, with a variational structure that generalizes the standard variational structure on $P_2(M)$ provided by optimal transport theory. Our approach makes use of tools from category theory to lift the geometric structure of the manifold $M$ to the spaces $P^{(n)}_2(M)$, in order to establish in a principled way a rigorous theoretical framework for variational analysis on the space $P^{(n)}_2(M)$. In particular, we obtain a precise characterization of the constant speed geodesics of the space $P^{(n)}_2(M)$ in terms of optimal velocity plans. Moreover, we introduce a notion of gradient for functionals defined on $P^{(n)}_2(M)$, which allows us to study the differentiability and the convexity of various types of such functionals.

Abstract: As a key circular economy strategy, remanufacturing allows original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to reduce waste by restoring used products to ``as-new'' conditions. This paper investigates an OEM's optimal remanufacturing business model by incorporating consumer perceptions into price and production quantity decisions. We analyze three alternative models: no remanufacturing, OEM in-house remanufacturing, and third-party remanufacturer (TPR) authorized remanufacturing. We extend the authorization with a two-part tariff contract and consider a stochastic market size. Through a numerical approach, we optimize price and quantity decisions based on consumer perceptions and develop a hierarchical decision roadmap to guide model selection. Our findings show that when consumer's perceived value of remanufactured products is high, OEM in-house remanufacturing is most profitable and reduces environmental impacts, but generally leads to a market dominated by remanufactured products. In contrast, when consumer's perceived value of remanufactured products is moderate and TPR remanufacturing significantly increases the perceived value of new products, the TPR-authorized remanufacturing is most profitable. It typically boosts total market sales, but accordingly increases environmental impacts. In addition, sensitivity analysis indicates that two-part authorization contracts are more advanced in meeting stringent environmental requirements than one-part contracts. Incorporating market size stochasticity enhances system profitability while keeping environmental impacts within a limited scope.

Abstract: Multi-stage decision problems under uncertainty can be efficiently solved with the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm. However, traditional implementations require all stage problems to be feasible. Feasibility is usually enforced by adding slack variables and penalizing them in the objective function, a process that depends on case-specific calibration and often distorts the economic interpretation of results. This paper proposes the Penalty-Free SDDP, an extension that introduces a Future Feasibility Function alongside the traditional Future Cost Function. The new recursion handles infeasibilities automatically, distinguishing between temporary and truly infeasible cases, and propagates feasibility information across stages through dedicated feasibility cuts. The approach was validated in a large-scale deterministic case inspired by the Brazilian hydrothermal system, achieving equivalent feasibility to the benchmark solution while eliminating miscalibrated artificial penalties. Results confirm its robustness and practicality as a foundation for future stochastic, multi-stage applications.

Abstract: In controlled industrial environments, ensuring safety and performance during controller tuning is a challenging and critical task. In particular, control loops in compressor-plenum-throttle systems cannot tolerate costly interruptions, and aggressive excitation may lead to unsafe operating regimes. Given the wide availability of historical data, this paper introduces a counterfactual explainability approach for sample-efficient retuning of compressor control loops. The proposed data-driven algorithm determines, without an explicit plant model or previous control law, the smallest controller adjustment required to achieve predefined performance specifications while guaranteeing stability. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In large-scale AI training, Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (s-MoE) layers enable scaling by activating only a small subset of experts per token. An operational challenge in this design is load balancing: routing tokens to minimize the number of idle experts, which is important for the efficient utilization of (costly) GPUs. We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB) procedure -- proposed by DeepSeek's Wang et al. (2024) -- by casting it as a one-step-per-iteration primal-dual method for an assignment problem. First, in a stylized deterministic setting, our framework yields several insightful structural properties: (i) a monotonic improvement of a Lagrangian objective, (ii) a preference rule that moves tokens from overloaded to underloaded experts, and (iii) an approximate-balancing guarantee. Then, we incorporate the stochastic and dynamic nature of AI training using a generalized online optimization formulation. In the online setting, we derive a strong convexity property of the objective that leads to a logarithmic expected regret bound under certain step-size choices. Additionally, we present real experiments on 1B-parameter DeepSeekMoE models to complement our theoretical findings. Together, these results build a principled framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing of s-MoE in AI models.

The failure of lower semicontinuity together with the lack of upper semicontinuity at infinitely many points of certain real-valued strongly quasiconvex functions are also shown.

Abstract: Large-scale problems in data science are often modeled with optimization, and the optimization model is usually solved with first-order methods that may converge at a sublinear rate. Therefore, it is of interest to terminate the optimization algorithm as soon as the underlying data science task is accomplished. We consider FISTA for solving two binary classification problems: the ellipsoid separation problem (ESP), and the soft-margin support-vector machine (SVM). For the ESP, we cast the dual second-order cone program into a form amenable to FISTA and show that the FISTA residual converges to the infimal displacement vector of the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm, that directly encodes a separating hyperplane. We further derive a data-dependent iteration upper bound scaling as $\mathcal{O}(1/δ_{\mathcal{A}}^2)$, where $δ_{\mathcal{A}}$ is the minimal perturbation that destroys separability. For the SVM, we propose a strongly-concave perturbed dual that admits efficient FISTA updates under a linear time projection scheme, and with our parameter choices, the objective has small condition number, enabling rapid convergence. We prove that, under a reasonable data model, early-stopped iterates identify well-classified points and yield a hyperplane that exactly separates them, where the accuracy required of the dual iterate is governed by geometric properties of the data. In particular, the proposed early-stopping criteria diminish the need for hard-to-select tolerance-based stopping conditions. Our numerical experiments on ESP instances derived from MNIST data and on soft-margin SVM benchmarks indicate competitive runtimes and substantial speedups from stopping early.

Abstract: Epiphytic communities offer an original framework to disentangle the contributions of environmental filters, biotic interactions and dispersal limitations to community structure at fine spatial scales. We determine here whether variations in light, microclimatic conditions and host tree size affect the variation in species composition and phylogenetic structure of epiphytic bryophyte communities, and hence, assess the contribution of environmental filtering, phylogenetic constraints and competition to community assembly.A canopy crane giving access to 1.1 ha of tropical rainforest in Yunnan (China) was employed to record hourly light and microclimatic conditions from 54 dataloggers and epiphytic bryophyte communities from 408 plots. Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling was implemented to analyse the relationship between taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover among epiphytic communities, host-tree characteristics and microclimatic variation.Within-tree vertical turnover of bryophyte communities was significantly about 30% higher than horizontal turnover among-trees. Thus, the sharp vertical variations in microclimatic conditions from tree base to canopy are more important than differences in age, reflecting the likelihood of colonization, area, and habitat conditions between young and old trees, in shaping the composition of epiphytic bryophyte communities.

Abstract: This study presents an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate staff and resident interactions within a synthetic aged care facility, capturing movement, task execution, and proximity-based contact events across three staff shifts and varying levels of resident care. Contacts were defined by spatial thresholds (1.5 m and 3 m) and cumulative duration, enabling the generation of detailed contact matrices. Simulation results showed that low and medium care residents experienced the highest frequency of interactions, particularly with staff on morning and afternoon shifts, while high care residents and night staff had substantially fewer contacts. Contact rates varied significantly by care level and shift, confirmed through Poisson-based regression modelling. Temporal analyses revealed clustering of high-risk contacts during structured daily routines, especially communal and care activities. An integrated airborne transmission module, seeded with a single infectious staff member, demonstrated that infection risk was highest during high-contact shifts and among medium care residents. Vaccination scenarios reduced predicted transmission by up to 68\%, with the greatest impact observed when both staff and residents were vaccinated. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for contact heterogeneity in aged care and demonstrate the utility of ABMs for evaluating targeted infection control strategies in high-risk, enclosed environments.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive three-dimensional third-medium contact framework for modeling complex contact interactions in hyperelastic solids and pneumatically actuated systems. The proposed third-medium formulation embeds a fictitious medium (or third medium) between potentially interacting bodies, enabling a unified and robust treatment of hyperelastic contact and self-contact without the need for discretization of the contact interface. Unlike the widely studied two-dimensional problem, this paper extends the new regularization term given in Reference \cite{TMCWriggers2} to three-dimensional problems and ensures element quality in a third medium. Due to the need for higher-order elements for the regularization term, this paper details the linearization process of this problem within the finite element framework. In addition, pneumatically actuated systems are considered by introducing a pneumatic term to represent pneumatic loading (pressure or suction) and inducing contact caused by internal inflation. This approach is suitable for complex hyperelastic contact and self-contact, and has potential applications in the fields of soft robotics and flexible mechanisms. The framework is developed in a fully three-dimensional setting, making it also suitable for isogeometric methods and meshless methods. Several benchmark and application-level simulations demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and versatility of the proposed approach. The results highlight the capability of the three-dimensional third-medium model to handle challenging nonlinear contact scenarios relevant to soft materials, soft actuators, and emerging multifunctional structures.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a pair of solutions to the open WDVV equations associated with the infinite-dimensional Frobenius manifolds that underlie the genus-zero universal Whitham hierarchy, and for the resulting flat F-manifolds, we explicitly construct their principal hierarchies. We further demonstrate that this construction is compatible with finite-dimensional reductions, yielding solutions for Frobenius manifolds associated with general rational superpotentials and those subject to a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetry reduction. In particular, the polynomial solutions derived by Basalaev and Buryak via open Saito theory for A- and D-type singularities are recovered as special cases.

Abstract: We present calculations that reconstruct electronic current densities in two stacked layers at known depths, using magnetic field data. Solving this inverse problem requires knowledge of the magnetic field in two planes -- one above both current layers, one below -- corresponding to non-invasive measurements of the field. We corroborate the accuracy of current density reconstruction from the resulting system of equations using a numerical simulation. This method is anticipated to be applicable to non-destructive current imaging for quality assurance in a range of applications featuring two-layer geometries, including printed circuit boards, capacitors, fuel cells, and battery cells; we focus particularly here on battery cells, due to their rapidly increasing relevance for automotive applications. This method also offers a framework for generalising the model to more than two layers in future work.

Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous mathematical framework for light propagation by constructing the optical phase space with its symplectic structure and the extended phase space with its contact structure. We prove that light rays in three-dimensional Euclidean space correspond to Reeb orbits in a five-dimensional contact manifold, which are then projected onto a four-dimensional symplectic manifold via symplectic reduction. Leveraging the advantages of phase space, we provide a rigorous definition of caustic surfaces as singularities of the Lagrangian submanifold projection and derive explicit expressions for caustic surfaces in convex lens systems. Furthermore, based on singularity theory, we present a complete classification of stable caustic surfaces and establish a correspondence with classical Seidel aberration theory. Building upon this theory, we propose a method of \emph{topological optical correction} that overcomes the limitations of traditional optimization algorithms in dealing with complex caustic structures. This work provides a new mathematical paradigm for the design and correction of high-precision optical systems.

Abstract: We investigate quantum Markov semigroups on bosonic Fock space and identify a broad class of infinite-dimensional dissipative evolutions that exhibit instantaneous Sobolev-regularization. Motivated by stability problems in quantum computation, we show that for certain Lindblad operators that are polynomials of creation and annihilation operators, the resulting dynamics immediately transform any initial state into one with finite expectation in all powers of the number operator. A key application is in the bosonic cat code, where we obtain explicit estimates in the trace norm for the speed of convergence. These estimates sharpen existing perturbative bounds at both short and long times, offering new analytic tools for assessing stability and error suppression in bosonic quantum information processing. For example, we improve the strong exponential convergence of the (shifted) $2$-photon dissipation to its fixed point to the uniform topology.

Abstract: This study proposes a new discrete neural operator for surrogate modeling of transient Darcy flow fields in heterogeneous porous media with random parameters. The new method integrates temporal encoding, operator learning and UNet to approximate the mapping between vector spaces of random parameter and spatiotemporal flow fields. The new discrete neural operator can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the SOTA attention-residual-UNet structure. Derived from the finite volume method, the transmissibility matrices rather than permeability is adopted as the inputs of surrogates to enhance the prediction accuracy further. To increase sampling efficiency, a generative latent space adaptive sampling method is developed employing the Gaussian mixture model for density estimation of generalization error. Validation is conducted on test cases of 2D/3D single- and two-phase Darcy flow field prediction. Results reveal consistent enhancement in prediction accuracy given limited training set.

Abstract: This contribution presents an integration method based on the Simpson quadrature. The integrator is designed for finite-dimensional nonlinear mechanical systems that derive from variational principles. The action is discretized using quadratic finite elements interpolation of the state and Simpson's quadrature, leading to discrete motion equations. The scheme is implicit, symplectic, and fourth-order accurate. The proposed integrator is compared with the implicit midpoint variational integrator on two examples of systems with inseparable Hamiltonians. First, the example of the nonlinear double pendulum illustrates how the method can be applied to multibody systems. The analytical solution of the Lagrange top is then used as a reference to analyze accuracy, convergence, and precision of the numerical method. A reduced Lagrange top system is also proposed and solved with a classical fourth-order method. Its solution is compared with the Simpson solution of the complete system, and the convergence order of the difference between both is consistent with the order of the classical method.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel numerical framework, the stochastic interacting particle-field method with particle-in-cell acceleration (SIPF-PIC), for the efficient simulation of the three-dimensional (3D) parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel (KS) systems. The SIPF-PIC method integrates Lagrangian particle dynamics with spectral field solvers, by leveraging localized particle-grid interpolations and fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques. For $P$ particles and $H$ Fourier modes per spatial dimension, the SIPF-PIC method achieves a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(P + H^3 \log H)$ per time step, a significant improvement over the original SIPF method (proposed in \cite{SIPF1}), which has a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(PH^3)$, while preserving numerical accuracy. Moreover, we establish a rigorous error analysis, proving that the discretization errors are of order $\mathcal{O}(H^{-16/13}+P^{-1/2}H^{4/13})$. Finally, we present numerical experiments to validate the theoretical convergence rates and demonstrate the computational efficiency of our new method. Notably, these experiments also show that the method captures complex blowup dynamics beyond single-point collapse, including ring-type singularities, where mass dynamically concentrates into evolving annular structures.

Abstract: This work is concerned with the numerical approximation of the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise and no-slip boundary conditions on a convex polygonal domain. The analysis is challenged by the solution's low spatial regularity and the non-Lipschitz nonlinearity. We derive a convergence rate in the mean-square sense for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, for the full discretization, we prove convergence in probability and establish an explicit rate with respect to the time step.

Abstract: Numerical simulation of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Euler (EE) system faces severe challenges due to the stringent physical admissibility constraints of relativistic fluids and the geometric singularities inherent in metric evolution. This paper proposes a high-order Constraint-Preserving (CP) compact Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin (cOEDG) method specifically tailored to address these difficulties. The method integrates a scale-invariant oscillation-eliminating mechanism [M. Peng, Z. Sun, K. Wu, Math. Comp., 94: 1147--1198, 2025] into a compact Runge--Kutta DG framework. By characterizing the convex invariant region of the hydrodynamic subsystem with general barotropic equations of state, we prove that the proposed scheme preserves physical realizability (specifically, positive density and subluminal velocity) directly in terms of conservative variables, thereby eliminating the need for complex primitive-variable checks. To ensure the geometric validity of the spacetime, we introduce a bijective transformation of the metric potentials. Rather than evolving the constrained metric components directly, the scheme advances unconstrained auxiliary variables whose inverse mapping automatically enforces strict positivity and asymptotic bounds without any limiters. Combined with a compatible high-order boundary treatment, the resulting CPcOEDG method exhibits robust stability and design-order accuracy in capturing strong gravity-fluid interactions, as demonstrated by simulations of black hole accretion and relativistic shock waves.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a high-order domain decomposition method for the ES-BGK model of the Boltzmann equation, which dynamically detects regions of equilibrium and non-equilibrium. Our implementation automatically switches between Euler equations in regions where the fluid is at equilibrium, and the ES-BGK model elsewhere. The main challenge addressed in this work is the development of a coupled strategy between the macroscopic and the kinetic solvers, which preserves the overall temporal order of accuracy of the scheme. A coupled IMEX method is introduced across decomposed subdomains and solvers. This approach is based on a coupled IMEX method and allows high accuracy and computational efficiency. Several numerical simulations in two space dimensions are performed, in order to validate the robustness of our approach and the expected temporal high-order convergence.

Abstract: Drag embedment anchors are a key threat to buried subsea linear infrastructure, such as power/data cables and pipelines. For cables, selecting a burial depth is a compromise between protecting the cable from anchor strike and the increased cost of deeper installation. This presents an efficient large deformation, elasto-plastic Material Point Method-based soil-structure interaction predictive tool for the estimation of anchor penetration based on Cone Penetration Test (CPT) site investigation data. The tool builds on earlier work by the authors supplemented by three developments: modelling assemblies of rigid bodies (necessary for articulated anchors), a partitioned domain approach to enable accurate and efficient modelling of long anchor pulls and an improved means of modelling rotational inertia. The tool is validated against scaled physical tests conducted in a geotechnical centrifuge on sands with a range of relative densities with good agreement across the tested conditions. Numerical simulations identify key issues with the UK Cable Burial Risk Assessment (CBRA) approach for estimating anchor penetration and reveal the potentially non-conservatism of the CBRA framework for sandy seabeds. The numerical model enables site-specific anchor-penetration assessment along cable routes and can be used to evaluate the performance of different anchor designs and sizes in varied soil conditions.

Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the convergence analysis of an asymptotic preserving particle scheme designed to serve as a particle pusher in a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for the Vlasov equation with a strong inhomogeneous magnetic field. The asymptotic preserving scheme that we study removes classical strong restrictive stability constraints on discretization steps while capturing the large-scale dynamics, even when the discretization is too coarse to capture fastest scales. Our error bounds are explicit regarding the discretization and stiffness parameters and match sharply numerical tests. The present analysis is expected to be representative of the general analysis of a class of schemes, developed by the authors, conceived as implicit-explicit schemes on augmented formulations.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of exponential integrators to advection-dominated problems. We focus on Krylov subspace and Leja interpolation methods to compute the action of exponential and related matrix functions. Complementing our earlier paper, arXiv:2410.12765 (to appear in Advances in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, 2025) based on a performance model, we extend the numerical investigation to higher-order Krylov approximations and new numerical regime, and assess their CPU-time efficiency relative to explicit Runge--Kutta schemes. We show that, depending on the problem setting, exponential integrators can either outperform or match explicit Runge--Kutta schemes. We also observe that Leja-based methods outperform Krylov iterations for large time steps, whereas for small time steps, Krylov-based methods provide better results than Leja-based methods.

Abstract: The nonuniform discrete Fourier transform (NUDFT) and its inverse are widely used in various fields of scientific computing. In this article, we propose a novel superfast direct inversion method for type-III NUDFT. The proposed method approximates the type-III NUDFT matrix as a product of a type-II NUDFT matrix and an HSS matrix, where the type-II NUDFT matrix is further decomposed into the product of an HSS matrix and an uniform discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix as in [Wilber, Epperly, and Barnett, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 47(3):A1702-A1732, 2025]. This decomposition enables both the forward application and the backward inversion to be accomplished with quasi-linear complexity. The fast inversion can serve as a high-accuracy direct solver or as an efficient preconditioner. Additionally, we provide an error bound for the approximation under specific sample distributions. Numerical results are presented to verify the relevant theoretical properties and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a semi-implicit arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method for the solution of the unified Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics. To handle the curl free involutions arising in the solid limit of the model, the original system is augmented by adopting a thermodynamically compatible generalized Lagrangian multiplier (GLM) approach. Next, an operator splitting strategy decouples the computation of fast pressure waves from the bulk velocity of the medium yielding a transport subsystem, containing convective terms and non-conservative products, and a Poisson-type subsystem, for the pressure. A second splitting yields an ODE subsystem comprising only the potentially stiff source terms, responsible for the relaxation of the model between its fluid and solid limits.
  The mesh motion can be driven by two sources: the local fluid velocity and a prescribed boundary displacement. For the spatial discretization, we employ unstructured staggered grids, with the pressure defined on the primal mesh and all remaining variables on the dual grid. The transport subsystem is advanced via an explicit finite volume method, in which integration over closed space-time control volumes ensures verification of the geometric conservation law (GCL). On the other hand, implicit continuous finite elements are used for the discretization of the pressure subsystem and an implicit DIRK scheme is employed to solve the ODE subsystem. Consequently, the proposed approach is well suited to address all Mach number flows. A comprehensive set of benchmarks is employed to assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology in tackling both fluid and solid mechanics problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic error distributions of symplectic methods for stochastic Hamiltonian systems and further provide Hamiltonian-specific analysis that clarifies the superiority of symplectic methods. Our contribution is threefold. First, we derive the asymptotic error distributions of symplectic methods for stochastic Hamiltonian systems with multiplicative noise and additive noise, respectively, and show that the obtained limiting stochastic processes satisfy equations retaining the Hamiltonian formulations. Second, we propose a new approach for calculating the asymptotic error distribution, revealing the connection between the stochastic modified equation and the asymptotic error distribution. Third, we characterize the limiting distribution of the normalized Hamiltonian deviation, thereby illustrating through test equations the superiority of symplectic methods for long-time simulations of the Hamiltonians, even in the limit as the step size tends to zero.

Abstract: We consider an elliptic partial differential equation in non-divergence form with a random diffusion matrix and random forcing term. To address this, we propose a mixed-type continuous finite element discretization in the physical domain, combined with a collocation discretization in the stochastic domain. For the mixed formulation, we first introduce a stochastic cost functional at the continuous level. This formulation is then enhanced to incorporate the vanishing tangential trace constraint directly into a mesh-dependent cost functional, rather than enforcing it in the solution's function space. In this context, we define a mesh-dependent norm and provide an error analysis based on this norm. We employ the collocation method by collocating the stochastic equation at the zeros of suitable tensor product orthogonal polynomials. This approach leads to a system of uncoupled deterministic problems, simplifying computation. Furthermore, we establish an a poriori error bound for the fully discrete approximation, detailing the convergence rates with respect to the discretization parameters. Finally, numerical results are presented to confirm and validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Inverse imaging problems rely on limited and indirect measurements, making reconstruction highly dependent on both regularization and sample locations. We introduce a novel greedy framework for the optimal selection of indirect measurements in the operator codomain, specifically tailored to inverse problems. Our approach employs a two-step scheme combining kernel-based interpolation and extrapolation. Within this framework, greedy schemes can be residual-based, where points are selected according to the current approximation error for a specific target function, or error-based, where points are chosen using a priori error indicators independent of the residual. For the latter, we derive explicit error bounds that quantify the propagation of approximation errors through both interpolation and extrapolation. Numerical applications to solar hard X-ray imaging demonstrate that the proposed greedy sampling strategy achieves high-quality reconstructions using only a few available measurements.

  The value of the slope parameter for the $π^0$ electromagnetic transition form factor,
  $a_π=0.0315\pm 0.0026_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm 0.0010_{\mathrm{syst}}$,
  is obtained from the analysis of $2.4\times10^6$ $π^0 \to e^+e^-γ$ observed decays.
  Within experimental uncertainties, it is in agreement with existing measurements and

Abstract: The hyperon weak radiative decay $Ξ^0\toγΣ^0$ is measured via the process $J/ψ\toΞ^0\barΞ^0$. The absolute branching fraction of $Ξ^0\toγΣ^0$ is determined to be $(3.69\pm 0.21_{\text{stat}}\pm0.12_{\text{syst}})\times 10^{-3}$, based on $(10.087\pm 0.044)\times 10^{9}$ $J/ψ$ events collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider. The decay asymmetry parameter is measured, with a complete angular analysis of the cascade decay chain, to be $α_γ = -0.807\pm 0.095_{\text{stat}}\pm 0.011_{\text{syst}}$.

Abstract: A deep-learning approach based on the transformer architecture is developed to distinguish between jets originating from quarks and gluons. The algorithm operates on jets with transverse momentum $p_{\text{T}} > 20$ and pseudorapidity $|η| < 4.5$ and takes as input several properties derived from the jet constituents, using information from the ATLAS detector's tracker and calorimeter. The algorithm's performance is evaluated by analyzing dijet data events from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ and $13.6$ TeV during Run 2 and Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider. Two methods are used to obtain distributions from quark- or gluon-initiated jets in data: a matrix method fully based on Monte Carlo simulation and a new approach named `jet topics' which has less dependence on the modelling of the physics process under study. The quark and gluon identification efficiencies measured in data for the 50% quark-identification-efficiency working point vary from the simulated ones for quark-initiated (gluon-initiated) jets by factors of 0.88-1.30 (0.61-1.05) with uncertainties of 10%-70% (10%-95%). The uncertainties estimated with the jet topics method are smaller than those estimated with the matrix method, with up to 20% less systematic uncertainty in some phase-space regions. The advances in jet identification reported here provide a robust tool for precision Standard Model measurements and searches for new physics at the LHC.

Abstract: We consider the Diophantine equation $$ a!b! = c! $$ due to Erdős, where we assume $a \leq b$. It is widely believed that there are only finitely many nontrivial solutions, and considerable work has been dedicated to showing this. In one direction, Luca (2007) showed that the set of $c$'s which can appear in solutions has density zero. Here we show that the set of $a$'s appearing in solutions is also sparse. In particular, $a$ cannot be one less than a large fraction of primes, and, under the assumption that $\sqrt[k]{a!} \mod 1$ is equidistributed in an appropriate sense, we show that the set of such $a$ has asymptotic density zero.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The distribution of prime constellations, such as Twin Primes ($p, p+2$), is traditionally analyzed via probabilistic models or analytic sieve theory. While heuristic predictions are accurate, rigorous proofs are obstructed by the "Parity Barrier", which prevents classical sieves from distinguishing primes from semi-primes in the asymptotic limit. In this work, we present a structural proof of existence based on deterministic signal processing. We treat the sequence of integers as a signal generated by a rigid Diophantine basis ($N=2n+3m$) and define a fundamental certification window $\mathcal{W} = [P, m_0^2)$ derived from the basis limit $m_0$. We demonstrate that the non-existence of constellations (the "Null Hypothesis") constitutes a low-entropy signal state, a "Prime Desert", that requires infinite spectral resolution to maintain over a quadratic window. Since the sieving basis is finite ($p \le m_0$), the system is band-limited and structurally incapable of synthesizing the destructive interference required to sustain a zero count. By invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem and analyzing the detailed correlation structure of residue classes, we prove that positive and negative correlations between sieved positions cancel at leading order, constraining the variance of the signal to scale linearly with the mean ($O(μ)$) rather than the quadratic scaling ($Ω(μ^2)$) required to support a Prime Desert. This Variance Gap implies that the signal must strictly oscillate around its mean, rendering the existence of prime constellations a mandatory consequence of the system's finite spectral bandwidth.

Abstract: Let $X$ be an arithmetic hyperbolic surface, $ψ$ a Hecke-Maass form, $\ell$ a geodesic segment on $X$, and $μ$ a Borel measure supported on $\ell$ with dimension greater than 1/2. We obtain a power saving over the local bound of Eswarathasan and Pramanik for the $L^2$ norm of $ψ$ with respect to $μ$, which is a weighted generalization of Marshall's geodesic restriction bound and is proved by applying the method of arithmetic amplification. On a general 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold, we also obtain a Kakeya-Nikodym bound for the $L^2$ norm of any Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction with respect to a Borel measure supported on a geodesic segment with dimension greater than 1/2.

Abstract: The Bateman--Horn Conjecture predicts how often an irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ assumes prime values. We demonstrate that with sufficient averaging in the coefficients of $f$ (viz. exponential in the size of the inputs), one can not only prove Bateman--Horn results on average but also pin down precise information about the distribution of prime values. We show that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^k$ sense for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$) satisfy the Bateman--Horn Conjecture, and that that 100\% of polynomials (in an $L^2$ sense) satisfy an appropriate polynomial analogue of the Hardy--Littlewood Prime Tuples Conjecture. We use the latter to prove that 100\% of polynomials satisfy the appropriate analogue of the Poisson Tail Conjecture, in the sense that the distribution of the gaps between consecutive prime values around the average spacing is Poisson.
  We also study the frequencies of sign patterns of the Liouville function evaluated at the consecutive outputs of $f$; viewing $f$ as a random variable, we establish the limiting distribution for every sign pattern. The Chowla problem along random polynomials is a special case. A key input behind all of our arguments is Leng's recent quantitative work on the higher-order Fourier uniformity of the von Mangoldt and Möbius functions (in turn relying on Leng, Sah, and Sawhney's quantitative inverse theorem for the Gowers norms).

Abstract: In this paper, motivated by some previous works in residue method and the recent theory of the relative Langlands duality, we prove a relative trace formula identity that compares the period integral of non-tempered spherical varieties with the period integral of a tempered spherical varieties associated to a Levi subgroup. This allows us to incorporate numerous relative trace formula comparisons studied during the last four decades under the relative Langlands duality framework. We will also propose a conjectural comparison for general non-tempered Hamiltonian spaces.

Unconditionally, this asymptotic formula was recently obtained by Garunkštis and Novikas in essentially the same region, with a slight incompleteness. Assuming RH, we obtain a sharper error term, and we also correct an inaccuracy in the unconditional error term there.

Our lifts are Hecke eigen cusp forms of weight $l$ ($l\ge n+2$, even) and come from elliptic newforms with respect to $\SL_2(\Z)$ which are of weight $l-\frac{n-2}{2}$ when $n$ is even and
  $2l-n+1$ when $n$ is odd.

Abstract: We say that an abelian variety is degenerate if its Hodge ring is not generated by divisor classes. Degeneracy leads to some interesting challenges when computing Sato-Tate groups, and there are currently few examples and techniques presented in the literature. In this paper we focus on the Jacobians of the family of curves $C_{p^2}: y^2=x^{p^2}-1$, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using a construction developed by Shioda in the 1980s, we are able to characterize so-called indecomposable Hodge classes as well as the Sato-Tate groups of these Jacobian varieties. Our work is inspired by computation, and examples and methods are described throughout the paper.

Abstract: We develop a Fourier--analytic framework for establishing spectral reciprocity formulas linking $\mathrm{GL}_3$ and $\mathrm{GL}_2$ automorphic spectra over number fields. The method applies uniformly to cuspidal and non-cuspidal $\mathrm{GL}_3$ representations and treats Motohashi-type and Blomer--Khan-type reciprocities in a parallel manner, revealing intrinsic connections between them and extending each to new settings. We also obtain explicit weight transforms in the analytic newvector and spherical cases. Applications include first-moment estimates for $\mathrm{GL}_3\times\mathrm{GL}_2$ $L$-functions over number fields, an explicit twisted fourth moment for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ $L$-functions over totally real fields, a sharp upper bound for the fifth moment, subconvexity for triple product $L$-functions, and new simultaneous nonvanishing results.

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field with a finite set $S$ of primes. We study the cohomology of $\mathbb{F}_p[G_{K,S}]$-modules $A$, in particular the Shafarevich groups $\Sha^i_S(K,A)$ for $i=1,2$ for tame sets $S$, i.e., for sets $S$ that contain no primes above $p$. When $S$ contains all primes above $p$ (the ``wild'' setting), it is a consequence of global Poitou-Tate duality that $\Sha^1_S(K,A')^\vee \simeq \Sha^2_S(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) $ is non-increasing as $S$ increases. The same applies when $G_{K,S}$ is replaced by its maximal pro-$p$ quotient $G_{K,S}(p)$. In [4] it was shown that for $S$ tame and $A=\mathbb{F}_p$ with trivial action, the group $\Sha^2_S(K, A)$ can increase as $S$ increases to $S\cup X$, and even attain its maximal dimension, $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p} \RusB_S(K,\mathbb{F}_p)$, for carefully chosen $X$. We strengthen this to general $\mathbb{F}_p[G_{K,S}]$-modules $A$ where $S$ is tame. We use Liu's definition [7] of $\RusB_S(K,A)$ to show that $\Sha^2_S(K,A) \hookrightarrow \RusB_S(K,A)$ and that there exist infinitely many tame sets of primes $X$ of $K$ such that $\Sha^2_{S\cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\hookrightarrow} \RusB_{S \cup X}(K,A) \stackrel{\simeq}{\twoheadleftarrow} \RusB_S(K,A) \hookleftarrow \Sha^2_S(K,A)$.

Abstract: In this paper, assuming the weak Schanuel Conjecture (WSC), we prove that for any collection of pairwise non-arithmetically equivalent totally real number fields, the residues at $s=1$ of their Dedekind zeta functions form a linearly independent set over the field of algebraic numbers. As a corollary, we obtain that, under WSC, two totally real number fields have the same regulator if and only if they have the same class number and Dedekind zeta function. We also prove that, under WSC, the isometry and similarity classes of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field of degree $[K:\Q]\geq 4$, characterize the isomorphism class of said field. All of our results follow from establishing that, under WSC, any Gram matrix of the log unit lattice of a real Galois number field yields a generic point of certain closed irreducible $\Q$-subvariety of the space of symmetric matrices of appropriate size.

Abstract: We prove an upper bound for the number of rational points of bounded height on irreducible affine hypersurfaces. More precisely, given an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X_1, \dots, X_n]$, we prove an upper bound on the number of points $(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{Q}^n$ such that $f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = 0$ and each component has height at most $B$. To prove this, we require a quantitative form of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, where we bound the number of reducible specialisations of an irreducible polynomial at rational points of bounded height.

Abstract: If $a$ and $b$ are integers with $b>a>1$, we completely characterize ``long'' arithmetic progressions in the sumsets of the geometric progressions $1, a, a^2, a^3, \ldots$ and $1, b, b^2, b^3, \ldots$. Our proofs utilize recent applications of bounds for linear forms in logarithms to $S$-unit equations, and consequences of the modularity of Frey-Hellegouarch curves, together with elementary arguments.

Abstract: The $k$-Markov numbers, introduced by Gyoda and Matsushita, are those which appear in positive integral solutions to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(xy + xz + yz) = (3+3k)xyz$. When $k =0$, this recovers the ordinary Markov numbers. A long-standing question in the theory of Markov numbers is Frobenius's unicity conjecture, concerning whether every Markov number is the maximum in a unique solution triple. Aigner gave a series of weaker, related conjectures which were confirmed to be true by Lee, Li, Rabideau, and Schiffler using techniques from the theory of cluster algebras. We show here that $k$-Markov numbers also satisfy Aigner's conjectures.

Abstract: We investigate the additive theory of the set $S = \{1^c, 2^c, \dots, N^c\}$ when $c$ is a real number. In the language of additive combinatorics, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of the additive energy of $S$. When $c$ is rational, this is either known, or follows from existing results, and our contribution is a resolution of the irrational case. We deduce that for all $c \not \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, the cardinality of the sumset $S + S$ asymptotically attains its natural upper bound $N(N + 1)/2$, as $N \to \infty$. We show that there are infinitely many, effectively computable numbers $c$ such that the set $\{p^c : \textrm{$p$ prime}\}$ is additively dissociated (actually linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$), and we provide an effective procedure to compute the digits of such $c$.

Abstract: Most climate trend studies analyze long-term trends as a proxy for climate dynamics. However, when examining seasonal data, it is unrealistic to assume that long-term trends remain consistent across all seasons. Instead, each season likely experiences distinct trends. Additionally, seasonal climate time series, such as seasonal maximum precipitation, often exhibit nonstationarities, including periodicities and location shifts. Failure to rigorously account for these features in modeling may lead to inaccurate trend estimates. This study quantifies seasonal trends in the contiguous United States' seasonal maximum precipitation series while addressing these nonstationarities. To ensure accurate trend estimation, we identify changepoints where the seasonal maximum precipitation shifts due to factors like measurement device changes, observer differences, or location moves. We employ a penalized likelihood method to estimate multiple changepoints, incorporating a generalized extreme value distribution with periodic features. A genetic algorithm based search algorithm efficiently explores the vast space of potential changepoints in both number and timing. Additionally, we compute seasonal return levels for extreme precipitation. Our methods are illustrated using two selected stations, and the results for the US are summarized through maps. We find that seasonal trends vary more when changepoints are considered than in studies that ignore them. Our findings also reveal distinct regional and seasonal patterns, with increasing trends more prevalent during fall in the South and along the East Coast when changepoints are accounted for.

Abstract: Prevalence surveys are routinely used to monitor the effectiveness of mass drug administration (MDA) programmes for controlling neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). We propose a decay-adjusted spatio-temporal (DAST) model that explicitly accounts for the time-varying impact of MDA on NTD prevalence, providing a flexible and interpretable framework for estimating intervention effects from sparse survey data. Using case studies on soil-transmitted helminths and lymphatic filariasis, we show that DAST offers a practical alternative to standard geostatistical models when the objective includes quantifying MDA impact and supporting short-term programmatic forecasting. We also discuss extensions and identifiability challenges, advocating for data-driven parsimony over complexity in settings where the available data are too sparse to support the estimation of highly parameterised models.

Abstract: The central theorem of topological graph theory states that the graph minor relation is a well-quasi-order on graphs. It has far-reaching consequences, in particular in the study of graph structures and the design of (parameterized) algorithms. In this article, we study two embedded versions of classical minor relations from structural graph theory and prove that they are also well-quasi-orders on general or restricted classes of embedded planar graphs. These embedded minor relations appear naturally for intrinsically embedded objects, such as knot diagrams and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  Handling the extra topological constraints of the embeddings requires careful analysis and extensions of classical methods for the more constrained embedded minor relations. We prove that the embedded version of immersion induces a well-quasi-order on bounded carving-width plane graphs by exhibiting particularly well-structured tree-decompositions and leveraging a classical argument on well-quasi-orders on forests. We deduce that the embedded graph minor relation defines a well-quasi-order on plane graphs via their directed medial graphs, when their branch-width is bounded. We conclude that the embedded graph minor relation is a well-quasi-order on all plane graphs, using classical grids theorems in the unbounded branch-width case.

Abstract: Observations of massive star-forming regions show that classical stellar wind models over-predict the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas, indicating a significant fraction of wind energy is lost. In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the giant HII region 30 Doradus and its central star cluster R136 using 2 Ms of Chandra X-ray Observatory data, combined with James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Spitzer spectral-energy distributions, to investigate how the hot gas energy is lost through turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, and physical leakage. We compare the spatial and spectral properties of the hot gas with those of the warm ionized gas and dust. We find no significant correlation between the dust and hot gas temperatures, suggesting they are not directly coupled and that the dust resides in the swept-up shells where it is heated radiatively. H$α$ and X-ray surface brightness profiles show that the X-rays peak interior to the H$α$ shells, demonstrating partial confinement of the hot gas. The fragmented shell structure and bright X-ray interior that declines near the H$α$ shell reflect efficient cooling from turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface. We compare against recent simulations of stellar-feedback driven bubbles which have broad agreement with the morphology of the X-ray and H$α$ emission, but the simulations produce a dip in the interior X-ray surface brightness and a lack of hard X-rays compared to the observations. These differences may suggest thermal conduction is important as mass-loading of the hot bubble could reproduce the X-ray observables.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of a bright gamma-ray burst GRB 230204B, analyzing both prompt and afterglow emissions. This GRB is highly energetic, with an isotropic equivalent energy emission $E_{\mathrm{iso}} \sim 2.2 \times 10^{54}\ \mathrm{erg}$, released during the prompt emission. The GROWTH-India Telescope discovered a bright afterglow ($m_r = 15.55$) that faded rapidly ($\propto t^{-1.82}$). The prompt emission shows strong thermal photospheric emission, along with a non-thermal high-energy component. We explore the evolution of these components and find them to be consistent with theoretical expectations. Afterglow modeling reveals an energetic jet $E_{tot} \gtrsim 10^{52}\ \mathrm{erg}$ expanding into a wind-type medium viewed nearly on-axis, suggesting a massive star progenitor with strong winds. We also explore correlations between the prompt emission and afterglow that may help to understand the complete picture of GRB progenitors.

Abstract: We investigate the physics of quasi-parallel trans-relativistic shocks propagating in weakly magnetized plasmas by means of long-duration two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations $(σ\gtrsim10^{-3})$, whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations $(σ\lesssim10^{-4})$. Bell-dominated shocks efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim0.2$ of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as $E_{\max}\propto t$. A much smaller fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\ll0.1$ of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell-dominated regime. On the other hand, Weibel-dominated shocks efficiently generate both nonthermal ions and electrons with $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\sim0.1$, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, $E_{\mathrm{max}}\propto t^{1/2}$. Our results are applicable to a wide range of trans-relativistic shocks, including the termination shocks of extragalactic jets, the late stages of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and shocks in fast blue optical transients.

Abstract: We present new Chandra observations of seven luminous quasars at $z>6.5$. Combined with archival Chandra observations of all other known quasars, they form nearly complete X-ray observations of all currently known $z\sim7$ quasars with $M_{1450}<-26.5$, except for J0313$-$1806 at $z=7.642$ and J0910$-$0414 at $z=6.636$. Together with existing ground-based NIR spectroscopy and ALMA observations, we investigate the correlations between X-ray emission (the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and the optical/UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $α_{\rm OX}$) and various quasar properties (rest-UV luminosity $L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$, bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, C IV blueshift, and infrared luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$). We find most $z>6.5$ quasars follow a similar $α_{\rm OX}-L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$ relation as $z\sim1-6$ quasars, but also display a large scatter. We find a potential correlation between $α_{\rm OX}$ and the C IV blueshift, suggesting a soft optical/UV-to-X-ray SED shape is frequently associated with fast disk winds. Furthermore, we analyze the X-ray spectrum of 11 quasars at $z>6.5$ with Chandra detection, and find the best-fit photon index $Γ$ is $2.41\pm0.27$, which is likely driven by high accretion rates of $z>6.5$ quasars. In addition, we find there are no significant correlations between either $L_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, nor $L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, suggesting no strong correlations between quasar luminosity and star formation luminosity for the most luminous quasars at $z>6.5$.

Abstract: Large-scale magnetic fields are relevant for a number of dynamical processes in accretion disks, including driving turbulence, reconnection events, and launching outflows. Numerical simulations have indicated that the initial strengths and configurations of the large-scale magnetic fields have a direct imprint on the outcome of an accretion disk evolution. To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $α_\text{SS}$. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce butterfly diagrams seen in previous local and global simulations. With rather aggressive parameter choice of $α_\text{SS}=0.02$ and black hole spin $a_\text{BH}=0.9375$, our thin-disk model launches weak collimated polar outflows with Lorentz factor $\simeq 1.2$, but no polar outflow is present with less vigorous turbulence or less positive $a_\text{BH}$. With negative $a_\text{BH}$, we find the field configurations to appear more similar to Newtonian cases, whereas for positive $a_\text{BH}$, the poloidal field loops become distorted and the cycle period becomes sporadic or even disappears. Moreover, we demonstrate how $α_\text{SS}$ can avoid to be prescribed and instead be determined by the local plasma beta. Such a fully dynamical subgrid dynamo allows for self-consistent amplification of the large-scale magnetic fields.

Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of the central engine powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), modelled as a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) powering GRBs.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients that probe extreme astrophysical environments. Many FRBs exhibit multi-component structures, which encode information about their emission mechanisms or progenitor systems and thus provide important clues to their origins. In this work, we systematically analyze the burst morphology of FRB 20190520B and compare component distributions across four active FRBs observed with FAST: FRB 20121102A, FRB 20190520B, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20240114A. We find that multi-component burst-clusters show spectral properties similar to single-peak bursts, and no periodicity is detected in their temporal behavior. The component-count distributions follow a power law, revealing scale-free behavior consistent with self-organized criticality (SOC) processes. Multi-component clusters account for 12-30% of all detected bursts, regardless of source activity, providing new insights into burst-to-burst variability and the physical processes driving FRB emission.

Abstract: We study the Compton-rocket effect of multi-photon interacting with electrons in an opaque fireball (or fire spot) of photons and $e^-e^+$ pairs at temperature $T_γ\gg m_e$. We find the charged-particle acceleration and the avalanche runaway process, leading to a non-trivial probability of ultra-high-energy (UHE) electrons and protons, which subsequently produce very-high-energy (VHE) photons and neutrinos. We show such peculiar dynamics using the Gamma-Ray Burst central engine fireball, whose inner part inflows and forms a gravitationally trapped fireshell (halo) around a black hole. The halo is a metastable, cooling via UHE particle emissions and blackbody radiation. We calculate the UHE particle luminosity varying in time, and discuss the peculiar features of such produced UHE particles, which lead to VHE particles, in connection with possible numerical simulations, observations and experiments.

Abstract: We present early-time observations of the broad-lined Type Ic supernova SN 2020lao, including optical spectroscopy beginning about 48 hr after the inferred explosion and extending to about 100 days. The explosion epoch is constrained with power-law fits to the rising TESS and ZTF light curves, with the first ZTF detection only about 27 hr after explosion. The optical light curves show a rapid 8.8 day rise and a peak luminosity typical of SNe Ic-BL (Mr=-18.5 mag). Unlike some engine-driven events, SN 2020lao shows no early optical excess or afterglow. The lack of a shock-cooling signature in the TESS/ZTF data constrains the progenitor to a compact Wolf Rayet-like star with radius of only a few solar radii. The spectra resemble those of the X-ray flash SN 2006aj but with higher velocities. Arnett modeling of the bolometric light curve, combined with Fe II velocities, yields a nickel mass of about 0.2 solar masses, an ejecta mass of about 3.2 solar masses, and a kinetic energy of about 23x10^51 erg, corresponding to a high specific kinetic energy of about 7x10^51 erg per solar mass. Spectral-synthesis modeling broadly reproduces the photospheric spectra and suggests a somewhat lower but still large specific kinetic energy (about 5 x 10^51 erg per solar mass). Although SN 2020lao and SN 2006aj produced similar 56Ni masses, SN 2020lao exhibits specific kinetic energies larger by a factor of several. Published VLA and Swift/XRT non-detections show no radio or X-ray afterglow, placing strong limits on relativistic ejecta and dense circumstellar material. Given its high specific kinetic energy, the absence of early excess emission and the radio/X-ray non-detections imply that any jet was either far off-axis or choked; otherwise, SN 2020lao represents an extreme non-relativistic SN Ic-BL.

Abstract: We investigate how gravitational wave (GW) observations can probe the internal physics of neutron stars by extending the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff framework to include pressure anisotropy and internal magnetic fields. Two representative magnetic field configurations, radial orientation dominated (RO) and transverse orientation dominated (TO), are implemented with strength and decay prescriptions. We found that both anisotropy and magnetic fields increase the maximum supported mass and modify the tidal deformability $Λ$, thereby imprinting measurable signatures on GW signals. For the equal mass binary ($1.2M_\odot$-$1.2M_\odot$), anisotropy neutron star with RO magnetic field yield more compact stars and a larger shift in $Λ$, allowing discrimination at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as low as $\sim18$ using the O4 power spectra density. TO fields produce weaker effects and require substantially higher SNRs for detection. In conclusion, we conclude that gravitational waves are capable of probing the internal structure of neutron stars.

Abstract: Spectropolarimetry provides a unique probe of ejecta asphericities, offering direct insights into the underlying explosion physics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $λ$6355 Åline. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer's viewing angle $θ$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia. Our results imply viewing-angle-dependent luminosities in our local sample, which may have implications when using high-redshift SNe Ia as evidence for the need of non-standard cosmology.

Abstract: Although historically classified into discrete subclasses, there is growing evidence that indicates that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) categories often overlap, reflecting continuous variations in progenitor structure, mass-loss history, and circumstellar environments rather than strictly distinct channels. In this review, we explore the proposed continua that link hydrogen-rich Type II SNe to stripped-envelope explosions (IIb-Ib-Ic), and that extend further into interaction-dominated and superluminous events. We discuss the physical processes-stellar winds, binary interaction, eruptive outbursts, and circumstellar interaction-that may produce graded outcomes across classes, while highlighting where observational evidence supports or challenges smooth transitions. We propose that CCSNe are better viewed as a multidimensional continuum of explosion outcomes, where traditional subclasses act as reference points rather than strict boundaries. Future progress will rely on large, homogeneous datasets and advanced modeling to disentangle true evolutionary sequences from apparent overlaps, ultimately connecting progenitor pathways to the observed diversity of explosions

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host emergent, fractionalized fermionic excitations that are charge-neutral. Identifying clear experimental signatures of these excitations remains a central challenge in the field of strongly correlated systems, as they do not couple to conventional electromagnetic probes. Here, we propose lattice strain as a powerful and tunable probe: Mechanical deformation of the lattice generates large pseudomagnetic fields, inducing pseudo-Landau levels that serve as distinctive spectroscopic signatures of these excitations. Using the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we show that distinct QSL phases exhibit strikingly different strain responses. The semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and the gapped chiral spin liquid display pronounced Landau quantization and a diamagnetic-like response to strain, whereas the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without forming Landau levels. These contrasting behaviors provide a direct route to experimentally identifying and distinguishing QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. We further outline how local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy can detect the strain-induced resonances associated with these responses, offering a practical pathway towards identifying fractionalized excitations in candidate materials.

Abstract: Multilayer graphene with different stacking sequences has emerged as a powerful setting for correlated and topological phases. In parallel, progress in graphene heterostructures with magnetic or correlated materials-most notably the Kitaev candidate $α$-RuCl$_3$-has demonstrated charge transfer, magnetic proximity effects, and interfacial reconstruction, creating new opportunities for engineered quantum systems. Motivated by these developments, we explore a three-dimensional analogue in which $α$-RuCl$_3$ layers are inserted directly into the van der Waals gaps of graphite, forming an intercalated system. Here, we report the successful synthesis and comprehensive characterization of graphite intercalated with $α$-RuCl$_3$. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, quantum oscillation measurements, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of these intercalated crystals. Our results demonstrate that graphite intercalated with $α$-RuCl$_3$ offers a robust route to develop three-dimensional materials with access to novel correlated and topological states.

Abstract: Results of combined thermal and electrical transport measurements through the magnetic field-induced quantum critical point in the heavy-fermion compound YbRh2Si2 are revisited to explore the relationship between the strange-metal behavior, observed in both the electrical and electronic thermal resistivity, and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the zero-temperature limit. A new type of inelastic scattering center for the charge and heat carriers has been detected and ascribed to the small-to-large Fermi-surface fluctuations. These are operating in the vicinity of and at the Kondo-destroying quantum critical point as fermionic quantum critical fluctuations and are considered the primary driver of the strange-metal behavior and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law.

Abstract: Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.
  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.
  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.

Abstract: Quantum simulations are a powerful tool for exploring strongly correlated many-body phenomena. Yet, their reach is limited by the fermion sign problem, which causes configuration weights to become negative, compromising statistical sampling. In auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the doped Hubbard model, neglecting the sign ${\cal S}$ of the weight leads to qualitatively wrong results -- most notably, an apparent suppression rather than enhancement of $d$-wave pairing at low temperature. Here we approach the problem from a different perspective: instead of identifying negative-weight paths, we examine the statistics of measured observables in a sign-resolved manner. By analyzing histograms of key quantities (kinetic energy, antiferromagnetic structure factor, and pair susceptibilities) for configurations with ${\cal S}=\pm1$, we derive an exact relation linking the bias from ignoring the sign to the difference between sign-resolved means, $Δμ$, and the average sign, $\langle {\cal S}\rangle$. Our framework provides a precise diagnostic of the origin of measurement bias in Quantum Monte Carlo and clarifies why observables such as the $d$-wave susceptibility are especially sensitive to the sign problem.

Abstract: Condensed mathematics as developed by Clausen and Scholze yields a version of derived functors over the category of continuous $G$-modules for a Hausdorff topological group $G$. We study the resulting notion of group cohomology and its relation to continuous group cohomology and the condensed/sheaf/singular cohomology of classifying spaces. While condensed group cohomology is generally a more refined invariant than continuous group cohomology, we show that for a broad class of topological groups, continuous group cohomology with solid coefficients, such as locally profinite continuous $G$-modules, can be realized as a derived functor in the condensed setting. We also revisit cornerstones of condensed mathematics, paying special attention to set-theoretic size issues. To this end, we review a framework for working with accessible (hyper)sheaves on large sites satisfying suitable accessibility conditions and show that the associated categories retain many topos-like properties. Moreover, we generalize identifications of condensed with sheaf cohomology obtained by Clausen and Scholze.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The deployment of multi-agent systems in dynamic, adversarial environments like robotic soccer necessitates real-time decision-making, sophisticated cooperation, and scalable algorithms to avoid the curse of dimensionality. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework, existing methods often struggle with the multi-granularity of tasks (long-term strategy vs. instant actions) and the complexity of large-scale agent interactions. This paper presents a unified Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that addresses these challenges. First, we establish a baseline using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a client-server architecture for real-time action scheduling, with PPO demonstrating superior performance (4.32 avg. goals, 82.9% ball control). Second, we introduce a Hierarchical RL (HRL) structure based on the options framework to decompose the problem into a high-level trajectory planning layer (modeled as a Semi-Markov Decision Process) and a low-level action execution layer, improving global strategy (avg. goals increased to 5.26). Finally, to ensure scalability, we integrate mean-field theory into the HRL framework, simplifying many-agent interactions into a single agent vs. the population average. Our mean-field actor-critic method achieves a significant performance boost (5.93 avg. goals, 89.1% ball control, 92.3% passing accuracy) and enhanced training stability. Extensive simulations of 4v4 matches in the Webots environment validate our approach, demonstrating its potential for robust, scalable, and cooperative behavior in complex multi-agent domains.

Abstract: Large robot fleets are now common in warehouses and other logistics settings, where small control gains translate into large operational impacts. In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution. The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.

Abstract: Long-horizon dynamical prediction is fundamental in robotics and control, underpinning canonical methods like model predictive control. Yet, many systems and disturbance phenomena are difficult to model due to effects like nonlinearity, chaos, and high-dimensionality. Koopman theory addresses this by modeling the linear evolution of embeddings of the state under an infinite-dimensional linear operator that can be approximated with a suitable finite basis of embedding functions, effectively trading model nonlinearity for representational complexity. However, explicitly computing a good choice of basis is nontrivial, and poor choices may cause inaccurate forecasts or overfitting. To address this, we present Kalman-Implicit Koopman Operator (KALIKO) Learning, a method that leverages the Kalman filter to implicitly learn embeddings corresponding to latent dynamics without requiring an explicit encoder. KALIKO produces interpretable representations consistent with both theory and prior works, yielding high-quality reconstructions and inducing a globally linear latent dynamics. Evaluated on wave data generated by a high-dimensional PDE, KALIKO surpasses several baselines in open-loop prediction and in a demanding closed-loop simulated control task: stabilizing an underactuated manipulator's payload by predicting and compensating for strong wave disturbances.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) holds great potential for learning repetitive manipulation tasks, such as those in industrial assembly. However, its effectiveness is often limited by insufficient trajectory precision due to compounding errors. In this paper, we introduce Grasped Object Manifold Projection (GOMP), an interactive method that mitigates these errors by constraining a non-rigidly grasped object to a lower-dimensional manifold. GOMP assumes a precise task in which a manipulator holds an object that may shift within the grasp in an observable manner and must be mated with a grounded part. Crucially, all GOMP enhancements are learned from the same expert dataset used to train the base IL policy, and are adjusted with an n-arm bandit-based interactive component. We propose a theoretical basis for GOMP's improvement upon the well-known compounding error bound in IL literature. We demonstrate the framework on four precise assembly tasks using tactile feedback, and note that the approach remains modality-agnostic. Data and videos are available at williamvdb.github.io/GOMPsite.

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) is an active research area, as it enables accurate real-time state estimation in GPS-denied environments. Recent advances in map data structures and spatial indexing have significantly improved the efficiency of LIO systems. Nevertheless, we observe that two aspects may still leave room for improvement: (1) nearest neighbor search often requires examining multiple spatial units to gather sufficient points for plane fitting, and (2) plane parameters are typically recomputed at every iteration despite unchanged map geometry. Motivated by these observations, we propose Surfel-LIO, which employs a hierarchical voxel structure (hVox) with pre-computed surfel representation. This design enables O(1) correspondence retrieval without runtime neighbor enumeration or plane fitting, combined with Z-order curve encoding for cache-friendly spatial indexing. Experimental results on the M3DGR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly faster processing speed compared to recent state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable state estimation accuracy. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/93won/lidar_inertial_odometry.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing scene representation methods for robotics, covering traditional representations such as point clouds, voxels, signed distance functions (SDF), and scene graphs, as well as more recent neural representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and the emerging Foundation Models. While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics. We have published an open-source project on GitHub and will continue to add new works and technologies to this project.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation of terrestrial robots using Reinforcement Learning (RL) from LIDAR observations remains challenging due to the high dimensionality of sensor data and the sample inefficiency of model-free approaches. Conventional policy networks struggle to process full-resolution LIDAR inputs, forcing prior works to rely on simplified observations that reduce spatial awareness and navigation robustness. This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework built on top of the DreamerV3 algorithm, integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron Variational Autoencoder (MLP-VAE) within a world model to encode high-dimensional LIDAR readings into compact latent representations. These latent features, combined with a learned dynamics predictor, enable efficient imagination-based policy optimization. Experiments on simulated TurtleBot3 navigation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves faster convergence and higher success rate compared to model-free baselines such as SAC, DDPG, and TD3. It is worth emphasizing that the DreamerV3-based agent attains a 100% success rate across all evaluated environments when using the full dataset of the Turtlebot3 LIDAR (360 readings), while model-free methods plateaued below 85%. These findings demonstrate that integrating predictive world models with learned latent representations enables more efficient and robust navigation from high-dimensional sensory data.

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly enhanced motion planning for robotic manipulators by leveraging prior experiences within planning datasets. However, state-of-the-art neural motion planners are primarily trained on small datasets collected in manually generated workspaces, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution scenarios. Additionally, these planners often rely on monolithic network architectures that struggle to encode critical planning information. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion Policy with Dataset Synthesis powered by large language models (LLMs) and Fusion Action-Chunking Transformers (PerFACT), which incorporates two key components. Firstly, a novel LLM-powered workspace generation method, MotionGeneralizer, enables large-scale planning data collection by producing a diverse set of semantically feasible workspaces. Secondly, we introduce Fusion Motion Policy Networks (MpiNetsFusion), a generalist neural motion planner that uses a fusion action-chunking transformer to better encode planning signals and attend to multiple feature modalities. Leveraging MotionGeneralizer, we collect 3.5M trajectories to train and evaluate MpiNetsFusion against state-of-the-art planners, which shows that the proposed MpiNetsFusion can plan several times faster on the evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Robots are often required to localize in environments with unknown object classes and semantic ambiguity. However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments.

Abstract: World Foundation Models (WFMs) offer remarkable visual dynamics simulation capabilities, yet their application to precise robotic control remains limited by the gap between generative realism and control-oriented precision. While existing approaches use WFMs as synthetic data generators, they suffer from high computational costs and underutilization of pre-trained VLA policies. We introduce \textbf{AdaPower} (\textbf{Ada}pt and Em\textbf{power}), a lightweight adaptation framework that transforms general-purpose WFMs into specialist world models through two novel components: Temporal-Spatial Test-Time Training (TS-TTT) for inference-time adaptation and Memory Persistence (MP) for long-horizon consistency. Integrated within a Model Predictive Control framework, our adapted world model empowers pre-trained VLAs, achieving over 41\% improvement in task success rates on LIBERO benchmarks without policy retraining, while preserving computational efficiency and generalist capabilities.

Abstract: Transition control poses a critical challenge in Vertical Take-Off and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTOL UAV) development due to the tilting rotor mechanism, which shifts the center of gravity and thrust direction during transitions. Current control methods' decoupled control of altitude and position leads to significant vibration, and limits interaction consideration and adaptability. In this study, we propose a novel coupled transition control methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) driven controller. Besides, contrasting to the conventional phase-transition approach, the ST3M method demonstrates a new perspective by treating cruise mode as a special case of hover. We validate the feasibility of applying our method in simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating efficient controller development and migration while accurately controlling UAV position and attitude, exhibiting outstanding trajectory tracking and reduced vibrations during the transition process.

Abstract: Achieving generalizable embodied policies remains a key challenge. Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies. Our approach offers critical insights into utilizing the world model as an online training strategy and achieves an average 37.5% performance improvement over baselines under out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Motion planning schemes are used for planning motions of a manipulator from an initial pose to a final pose during a task execution. A motion planning scheme generally comprises of a trajectory planning method and an inverse kinematic solver to determine trajectories and joints solutions respectively. In this paper, 3 motion planning schemes developed based on Jacobian methods are implemented to traverse a redundant manipulator with a coupled finger gripper through given trajectories. RRT* algorithm is used for planning trajectories and screw theory based forward kinematic equations are solved for determining joint solutions of the manipulator and gripper. Inverse solutions are computed separately using 3 Jacobian based methods such as Jacobian Transpose (JT), Pseudo Inverse (PI), and Damped Least Square (DLS) methods. Space Jacobian and manipulability measurements of the manipulator and gripper are obtained using screw theory formulations. Smoothness and RMSE error of generated trajectories and velocity continuity, acceleration profile, jerk, and snap values of joint motions are analysed for determining an efficient motion planning method for a given task. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed motion planning schemes mentioned above are analysed using simulation studies to determine a suitable inverse solution technique for the tasks.

Abstract: We address the challenge of reliable and efficient interaction in autonomous multi-agent systems, where agents must balance long-term strategic objectives with short-term dynamic adaptation. We propose context-triggered contingency games, a novel integration of strategic games derived from temporal logic specifications with dynamic contingency games solved in real time. Our two-layered architecture leverages strategy templates to guarantee satisfaction of high-level objectives, while a new factor-graph-based solver enables scalable, real-time model predictive control of dynamic interactions. The resulting framework ensures both safety and progress in uncertain, interactive environments. We validate our approach through simulations and hardware experiments in autonomous driving and robotic navigation, demonstrating efficient, reliable, and adaptive multi-agent interaction.

Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous tomato-harvesting system built around a hybrid robotic gripper that combines six soft auxetic fingers with a rigid exoskeleton and a latex basket to achieve gentle, cage-like grasping. The gripper is driven by a servo-actuated Scotch--yoke mechanism, and includes separator leaves that form a conical frustum for fruit isolation, with an integrated micro-servo cutter for pedicel cutting. For perception, an RGB--D camera and a Detectron2-based pipeline perform semantic segmentation of ripe/unripe tomatoes and keypoint localization of the pedicel and fruit center under occlusion and variable illumination. An analytical model derived using the principle of virtual work relates servo torque to grasp force, enabling design-level reasoning about actuation requirements. During execution, closed-loop grasp-force regulation is achieved using a proportional--integral--derivative controller with feedback from force-sensitive resistors mounted on selected fingers to prevent slip and bruising. Motion execution is supported by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)--based trajectory planning for a 5-DOF manipulator. Experiments demonstrate complete picking cycles (approach, separation, cutting, grasping, transport, release) with an average cycle time of 24.34~s and an overall success rate of approximately 80\%, while maintaining low grasp forces (0.20--0.50~N). These results validate the proposed hybrid gripper and integrated vision--control pipeline for reliable harvesting in cluttered environments.

Abstract: In collaborative human-robot tasks, safety requires not only avoiding collisions but also ensuring safe, intentional physical contact. We present ContactRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that directly incorporates contact safety into the reward function through force feedback. This enables a robot to learn adaptive motion profiles that minimize human-robot contact forces while maintaining task efficiency. In simulation, ContactRL achieves a low safety violation rate of 0.2\% with a high task success rate of 87.7\%, outperforming state-of-the-art constrained RL baselines. In order to guarantee deployment safety, we augment the learned policy with a kinetic energy based Control Barrier Function (eCBF) shield. Real-world experiments on an UR3e robotic platform performing small object handovers from a human hand across 360 trials confirm safe contact, with measured normal forces consistently below 10N. These results demonstrate that ContactRL enables safe and efficient physical collaboration, thereby advancing the deployment of collaborative robots in contact-rich tasks.

Abstract: The US Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Autonomous Planning In-space Assembly Reinforcement-learning free-flYer (APIARY) experiment pioneers the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for control of free-flying robots in the zero-gravity (zero-G) environment of space. On Tuesday, May 27th 2025 the APIARY team conducted the first ever, to our knowledge, RL control of a free-flyer in space using the NASA Astrobee robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). A robust 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) control policy was trained using an actor-critic Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network within the NVIDIA Isaac Lab simulation environment, randomizing over goal poses and mass distributions to enhance robustness. This paper details the simulation testing, ground testing, and flight validation of this experiment. This on-orbit demonstration validates the transformative potential of RL for improving robotic autonomy, enabling rapid development and deployment (in minutes to hours) of tailored behaviors for space exploration, logistics, and real-time mission needs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers transformative potential for robotic control in space. We present the first on-orbit demonstration of RL-based autonomous control of a free-flying robot, the NASA Astrobee, aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using NVIDIA's Omniverse physics simulator and curriculum learning, we trained a deep neural network to replace Astrobee's standard attitude and translation control, enabling it to navigate in microgravity. Our results validate a novel training pipeline that bridges the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap, utilizing a GPU-accelerated, scientific-grade simulation environment for efficient Monte Carlo RL training. This successful deployment demonstrates the feasibility of training RL policies terrestrially and transferring them to space-based applications. This paves the way for future work in In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM), enabling rapid on-orbit adaptation to dynamic mission requirements.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is limited by both control and design, without consensus as to what makes manipulators best for performing dexterous tasks. This raises a fundamental challenge: how should we design and control robot manipulators that are optimized for dexterity? We present a co-design framework that learns task-specific hand morphology and complementary dexterous control policies. The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable evaluation across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components. We evaluate the approach across multiple dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation with simulation and real deployment. Our framework enables an end-to-end pipeline that can design, train, fabricate, and deploy a new robotic hand in under 24 hours. The full framework will be open-sourced and available on our website.

Abstract: Combining motion prediction and motion planning offers a promising framework for enhancing interactions between automated vehicles and other traffic participants. However, this introduces challenges in conditioning predictions on navigation goals and ensuring stable, kinematically feasible trajectories. Addressing the former challenge, this paper investigates the extension of attention-based motion prediction models with navigation information. By integrating the ego vehicle's intended route and goal pose into the model architecture, we bridge the gap between multi-agent motion prediction and goal-based motion planning. We propose and evaluate several architectural navigation integration strategies to our model on the nuPlan dataset. Our results demonstrate the potential of prediction-driven motion planning, highlighting how navigation information can enhance both prediction and planning tasks. Our implementation is at: https://github.com/KIT-MRT/future-motion.

Abstract: This paper presents an auto-tuning framework for torque-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (nMPC), where the MPC serves as a real-time controller for optimal joint torque commands. The MPC parameters, including cost function weights and low-level controller gains, are optimized using high-dimensional Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques, specifically Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace (SAASBO) with a digital twin (DT) to achieve precise end-effector trajectory real-time tracking on an UR10e robot arm. The simulation model allows efficient exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space, and it ensures safe transfer to hardware. Our simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in tracking performance (+41.9%) and reduction in solve times (-2.5%) compared to manually-tuned parameters. Moreover, experimental validation on the real robot follows the trend (with a +25.8% improvement), emphasizing the importance of digital twin-enabled automated parameter optimization for robotic operations.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used for motion planning, particularly in autonomous driving. Real-time capability of the planner requires utilizing convex approximation of optimal control problems (OCPs) for the planner. However, such approximations confine the solution to a subspace, which might not contain the global optimum. To address this, we propose using safe reinforcement learning (SRL) to obtain a new and safe reference trajectory within MPC. By employing a learning-based approach, the MPC can explore solutions beyond the close neighborhood of the previous one, potentially finding global optima. We incorporate constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to ensure safety in automated driving, using a handcrafted energy function-based safety index as the constraint objective to model safe and unsafe regions. Our approach utilizes a state-dependent Lagrangian multiplier, learned concurrently with the safe policy, to solve the CRL problem. Through experimentation in a highway scenario, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both MPC and SRL in terms of safety and performance measures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles still struggle to exhibit human-like behavior in highly dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios. The key challenge lies in AD's limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles, largely due to a lack of understanding the underlying mechanisms of social interaction. To address this issue, we introduce MPCFormer, an explainable socially-aware autonomous driving approach with physics-informed and data-driven coupled social interaction dynamics. In this model, the dynamics are formulated into a discrete space-state representation, which embeds physics priors to enhance modeling explainability. The dynamics coefficients are learned from naturalistic driving data via a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. To the best of our knowledge, MPCFormer is the first approach to explicitly model the dynamics of multi-vehicle social interactions. The learned social interaction dynamics enable the planner to generate manifold, human-like behaviors when interacting with surrounding traffic. By leveraging the MPC framework, the approach mitigates the potential safety risks typically associated with purely learning-based methods. Open-looped evaluation on NGSIM dataset demonstrates that MPCFormer achieves superior social interaction awareness, yielding the lowest trajectory prediction errors compared with other state-of-the-art approach. The prediction achieves an ADE as low as 0.86 m over a long prediction horizon of 5 seconds. Close-looped experiments in highly intense interaction scenarios, where consecutive lane changes are required to exit an off-ramp, further validate the effectiveness of MPCFormer. Results show that MPCFormer achieves the highest planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and reduces the collision rate from 21.25% to 0.5%, outperforming a frontier Reinforcement Learning (RL) based planner.

Abstract: The effectiveness of human-robot interaction often hinges on the ability to cultivate engagement - a dynamic process of cognitive involvement that supports meaningful exchanges. Many existing definitions and models of engagement are either too vague or lack the ability to generalize across different contexts. We introduce IM HERE, a novel framework that models engagement effectively in human-human, human-robot, and robot-robot interactions. By employing an effort-based description of bilateral relationships between entities, we provide an accurate breakdown of relationship patterns, simplifying them to focus placement and four key states. This framework captures mutual relationships, group behaviors, and actions conforming to social norms, translating them into specific directives for autonomous systems. By integrating both subjective perceptions and objective states, the model precisely identifies and describes miscommunication. The primary objective of this paper is to automate the analysis, modeling, and description of social behavior, and to determine how autonomous systems can behave in accordance with social norms for full social integration while simultaneously pursuing their own social goals.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp generation aims to produce grasp poses that align with task requirements and human interpretable grasp semantics. However, achieving semantically controllable dexterous grasp synthesis remains highly challenging due to the lack of unified modeling of multiple semantic dimensions, including grasp taxonomy, contact semantics, and functional affordance. To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world object grasping and ablation studies demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of grasp diversity, contact semantic diversity, functional affordance diversity, and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Active suspension systems are critical for enhancing vehicle comfort, safety, and stability, yet their performance is often limited by fixed hardware designs and control strategies that cannot adapt to uncertain and dynamic operating conditions. Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability. Contributions include: developing a DT-enabled CCD framework integrating DRL and uncertainty-aware model updating for full-vehicle active suspensions, introducing a multi-generation design strategy for self-improving systems, and demonstrating personalized optimization of active suspension systems for distinct driver types.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end pipeline for deploying reinforcement learning (RL) trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) on neuromorphic hardware by converting them into spiking Sigma-Delta Neural Networks (SDNNs). We demonstrate that an ANN policy trained entirely in simulation can be transformed into an SDNN compatible with Intel's Loihi 2 architecture, enabling low-latency and energy-efficient inference. As a test case, we use an RL policy for controlling the Astrobee free-flying robot, similar to a previously hardware in space-validated controller. The policy, trained with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), is converted to an SDNN and deployed on Intel's Loihi 2, then evaluated in NVIDIA's Omniverse Isaac Lab simulation environment for closed-loop control of Astrobee's motion. We compare execution performance between GPU and Loihi 2. The results highlight the feasibility of using neuromorphic platforms for robotic control and establish a pathway toward energy-efficient, real-time neuromorphic computation in future space and terrestrial robotics applications.

Abstract: Prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically trained on teleoperated successful demonstrations, while discarding numerous failed attempts that occur naturally during data collection. However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring. The selected subgoal sequence is then passed to System 1, which executes low-level actions without modifying the agent's core skills. Trained entirely from offline teleoperation data, VINE integrates negative experience directly into the decision loop. Across challenging manipulation tasks, this approach consistently improves success rates and robustness, demonstrating that failure data is an essential resource for converting the broad competence of VLAs into robust execution.

Abstract: Autonomous driving planning systems perform nearly perfectly in routine scenarios using lightweight, rule-based methods but still struggle in dense urban traffic, where lane changes and merges require anticipating and influencing other agents. Modern motion predictors offer highly accurate forecasts, yet their integration into planning is mostly rudimental: discarding unsafe plans. Similarly, end-to-end models offer a one-way integration that avoids the challenges of joint prediction and planning modeling under uncertainty. In contrast, game-theoretic formulations offer a principled alternative but have seen limited adoption in autonomous driving. We present Bayesian Iterative Best Response (BIBeR), a framework that unifies motion prediction and game-theoretic planning into a single interaction-aware process. BIBeR is the first to integrate a state-of-the-art predictor into an Iterative Best Response (IBR) loop, repeatedly refining the strategies of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. This repeated best-response process approximates a Nash equilibrium, enabling bidirectional adaptation where the ego both reacts to and shapes the behavior of others. In addition, our proposed Bayesian confidence estimation quantifies prediction reliability and modulates update strength, more conservative under low confidence and more decisive under high confidence. BIBeR is compatible with modern predictors and planners, combining the transparency of structured planning with the flexibility of learned models. Experiments show that BIBeR achieves an 11% improvement over state-of-the-art planners on highly interactive interPlan lane-change scenarios, while also outperforming existing approaches on standard nuPlan benchmarks.

Abstract: Agricultural robots are serving as powerful assistants across a wide range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily relying on manual operations or railway systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling a robot to navigate to a target position following a natural language instruction. Unlike human binocular vision, most agricultural robots are only given a single camera for monocular vision, which results in limited spatial perception. To bridge this gap, we present the method of Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation with Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE-AgriVLN), in which we propose the MDE module generating depth features from RGB images, to assist the decision-maker on reasoning. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our MDE-AgriVLN method successfully increases Success Rate from 0.23 to 0.32 and decreases Navigation Error from 4.43m to 4.08m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural VLN domain.

Abstract: Animals with foveated vision, including humans, experience microsaccades, small, rapid eye movements that they are not aware of. Inspired by this phenomenon, we develop a method for "Artificial Microsaccade Compensation". It can stabilize video captured by a tailless ornithopter that has resisted attempts to use camera-based sensing because it shakes at 12-20 Hz. Our approach minimizes changes in image intensity by optimizing over 3D rotation represented in SO(3). This results in a stabilized video, computed in real time, suitable for human viewing, and free from distortion. When adapted to hold a fixed viewing orientation, up to occasional saccades, it can dramatically reduce inter-frame motion while also benefiting from an efficient recursive update. When compared to Adobe Premier Pro's warp stabilizer, which is widely regarded as the best commercial video stabilization software available, our method achieves higher quality results while also running in real time.
