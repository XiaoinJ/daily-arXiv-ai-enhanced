Presented at the 2025 International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER)", "summary": "To manipulate objects in novel, unstructured environments, robots need task-oriented grasps that target object parts based on the given task. Geometry-based methods often struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes. We also demonstrate OVAL-Grasp's efficacy in scenarios that rely on visual features for part selection, and show the benefit of a modular design through our ablation experiments.

However, current teleoperation platforms typically lack integrated force feedback, cross-embodiment generalization, and portable, user-friendly designs, limiting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce ACE-F, a cross embodiment foldable teleoperation system with integrated force feedback. Our approach leverages inverse kinematics (IK) combined with a carefully designed human-robot interface (HRI), enabling users to capture precise and high-quality demonstrations effortlessly. We further propose a generalized soft-controller pipeline integrating PD control and inverse dynamics to ensure robot safety and precise motion control across diverse robotic embodiments. Critically, to achieve cross-embodiment generalization of force feedback without additional sensors, we innovatively interpret end-effector positional deviations as virtual force signals, which enhance data collection and enable applications in imitation learning. Extensive teleoperation experiments confirm that ACE-F significantly simplifies the control of various robot embodiments, making dexterous manipulation tasks as intuitive as operating a computer mouse.

Among various sensing modalities, visual input from cameras plays a central role, enabling robots to estimate their position by tracking point features across image frames. However, image frames often contain a large number of features, many of which are redundant or uninformative for localization. Processing all features can introduce significant computational latency and inefficiency. This motivates the need for intelligent feature selection, identifying a subset of features that are most informative for localization over a prediction horizon. In this work, we propose two fast and memory-efficient feature selection algorithms that enable robots to actively evaluate the utility of visual features in real time. Unlike existing approaches with high computational and memory demands, the proposed methods are explicitly designed to reduce both time and memory complexity while achieving a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and localization accuracy."}

Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $ω_{\\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $ω_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this."}

Yet, seat-belt compliance across different locales demands far more granular data than traditional, roadside surveys can provide. These surveys are spatially sparse, temporally intermittent, and costly to administer, often providing coarse-grained snapshots insufficient for capturing dynamic behavioral patterns or localized disparities. Telematics data emerges as a transformative alternative, offering continuous, high-resolution driver event records, such as seat belt latch status, across vast geographic areas. This granular and scalable data enables the application of advanced spatiotemporal models that more accurately reflect the complex interactions driving seatbelt use. This study utilizes telematics data to generate county-level seat belt compliance metrics for Iowa in 2022, employing a suite of beta-regression models that incorporate spatial and temporal random effects. The study findings demonstrate that models including both spatial and temporal components outperform those with spatial or temporal effects alone, underscoring the importance of jointly accounting for geographic clustering and temporal dynamics. Among explanatory variables, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and per capita income emerge as significant predictors of compliance rates. The significant spatial and temporal effects highlight that telematics-based granular data substantially enhances model fit and inference quality. The results demonstrate that integrating granular telematics data within sophisticated spatiotemporal frameworks significantly improves inference, providing policymakers with precise insights for targeted interventions and advancing traffic safety research."}

Yet, their understanding remains incomplete. Recent global Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations have raised several questions that led us to question their validity and their extrapolation to realistic particle Lorentz factors, electric and magnetic fields. We want to generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation from first principles. We propose a novel method to study the Equatorial Current Sheet (ECS) where most of the particle acceleration and the high-energy radiation is expected to originate. We first determine its shape and external magnetic field with a steady-state ideal force-free solution. Then, we consider the extra electric and magnetic field components that develop when dissipation is considered. Finally, we study the particle acceleration and radiation that is due to these extra field components for realistic field and particle parameters. We generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation and compare them with those obtained via PIC simulations. These sky maps may also be closely reproduced using the ECS of the split-monopole solution beyond the light cylinder. The ECS is probably stabilized by the normal magnetic field component that is due to the global magnetospheric reconnection. Our method helps us better understand the origin of the pulsed high-energy radiation in the pulsar magnetosphere."}

Rossmanith"], "title": "A Modified BGK Collision Operator for Exact Conservation in Numerical Solutions of Boltzmann-BGK", "comment": "13 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Ideal gases can be modeled by the Boltzmann equation from statistical physics. Instead of trying to track the position and velocity of a large number of gas molecules, it is possible to describe the particles with a particle distribution function. The Boltzmann equation provides the rule for evolving the distribution function over time, allowing one to simulate the gas dynamics. In this work, we develop a novel numerical method for solving the 1D1V Boltzmann-BGK equation. Several important ingredients are combined to create an accurate, efficient, robust numerical method valid in all flow regimes. First, we make use of operator splitting to create separate transport and collision sub-steps, each of which is easier to discretize than the whole system; second, we introduce a third-order accurate Lax-Wendroff-type scheme for the transport sub-step; third, we make use of the second-order L-stable TR-BDF method for the collision sub-step. The final component we introduce is a novel treatment of the collision sub-step to guarantee that the total mass, momentum, and energy are conserved even in the presence of a truncated velocity range and quadrature errors in computing moments. The key idea is to multiply the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the collision sub-step by a quadratic Hermite polynomial, where the coefficients in the polynomial are chosen to ensure exact conservation. The resulting scheme is verified on piecewise constant initial data with periodic boundary conditions; exact conservation up to machine precision is demonstrated for mass, momentum, and energy. The resulting method is implemented in a freely available Java code with Python plotting routines."}

However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit."}

Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals."}

Our goal is to constrain the physical conditions and dynamical states of the intracluster medium (ICM) through a data-driven approach. We employ a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify the most analogous simulated cluster to each observed system based on the morphology of their line-of-sight velocity maps. The model learns a high-dimensional similarity metric between observations and simulations, allowing us to capture subtle kinematic and structural patterns beyond traditional statistical tests. We find that the best-matching simulated halos reproduce the observed large-scale velocity gradients and local kinematic substructures, suggesting that the ICM motions in these clusters arise from a combination of gas sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor merger activity. Our results demonstrate that deep learning provides a powerful and objective framework for connecting X-ray observations to cosmological simulations, offering new insights into the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters and the mechanisms driving turbulence and bulk flows in the hot ICM."}

In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium."}

However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality.

This work introduces a novel third-order temporally accurate and stable numerical scheme for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, aiming to address the limitations in accuracy and efficiency often encountered with conventional approaches. Validation via nanostrip simulations confirms two principal advantages of the proposed method: it attains strict third-order temporal accuracy, surpassing many current techniques, and it offers superior computational efficiency, enabling rapid convergence without sacrificing numerical precision. For Gilbert damping coefficients $α$ ranging from $0.1$ to values below $10$, the scheme preserves strong stability and effectively avoids non-physical magnetization states. The magnetic microstructures predicted by this method are in excellent agreement with those from established benchmark methods, affirming its reliability for quantitative physical analysis. Salient distinctions between the proposed scheme and an existing third-order semi-implicit method include:\n  (1) Solving the linear system associated with the existing scheme demands substantially greater computational time, underscoring the need for highly efficient solvers;\n  (2) Although the proposed method shows increased sensitivity to damping parameters, it reliably converges to stable physical states and is effective in simulating magnetic domain wall motion, producing outcomes consistent with prior validated studies;\n  (3) The energy levels computed by the proposed method are significantly lower than those obtained via the existing third-order scheme."}

However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems."}

Motivated by horizon-scale very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and future missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), we analyze image morphology and interferometric visibilities to identify observational signatures that differentiate KNS from Kerr black holes. We find that higher-order photon rings are tightly concentrated within the nominal ``shadow'' region and that the shadow develops a pronounced gap at sufficiently large observer inclination. These morphological differences produce measurable deviations in the complex visibilities relative to Kerr black hole predictions. Our results indicate that photon-ring structure and visibility-domain diagnostics at horizon-resolving baselines can provide a direct observational test of the presence (or absence) of an event horizon and thus offer a concrete avenue to test general relativity with future horizon-scale observations."}

In this work, we propose a dual-domain deep learning framework to accelerate the computation of multiscale basis functions within MGMsFEM for solving Darcy flow problems. By extracting and decoding permeability field features in both the frequency and spatial domains, the method enables rapid generation of numerical matrices of multiscale basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining high approximation accuracy, thereby offering the potential for future applications in real-world reservoir engineering."}

From predator-prey dynamics to hierarchical epidemic models, we illustrate by example how to implement, diagnose, and interpret ABC-SMC analyses. Each example builds intuition about when and why ABC-SMC works, how partial observability affects parameter identifiability, and how hierarchical structures naturally emerge in Bayesian frameworks. All code leverages PyMC's modern probabilistic programming interface, ensuring reproducibility and easy adaptation to new problems.

LOVO has several practical applications such as robust parameter estimation, protein alignment, portfolio optimization, among others. In this work, we are interested in the constrained nonlinear optimization LOVO problem of minimizing the minimum between a finite number of function values subject to a nonempty closed convex set where each function is a black-box and continuously differentiable, but the derivatives are not available. We develop the first derivative-free trust-region algorithm for constrained LOVO problems with convergence to weakly critical points. Under suitable conditions, we establish the global convergence of the algorithm and also its worst-case iteration complexity analysis. An initial open-source implementation using only linear interpolation models is developed. Extensive numerical experiments and comparison with existing alternatives show the properties and the efficiency of the proposed approach when solving LOVO problems."}

Existing methods face a well-known trade-off: filter-based approaches are efficient but prone to drift, while optimization-based methods, though accurate, rely on computationally prohibitive Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) that is difficult to run on resource-constrained platforms. Rather than removing VIBA altogether, we aim to reduce how often and how heavily it must be invoked. To this end, we cast two key design choices in modern VIO, when to run the visual frontend and how strongly to trust its output, as sequential decision problems, and solve them with lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our framework introduces a lightweight, dual-pronged RL policy that serves as our core contribution: (1) a Select Agent intelligently gates the entire VO pipeline based only on high-frequency IMU data; and (2) a composite Fusion Agent that first estimates a robust velocity state via a supervised network, before an RL policy adaptively fuses the full (p, v, q) state. Experiments on the EuRoC MAV and TUM-VI datasets show that, in our unified evaluation, the proposed method achieves a more favorable accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off than prior GPU-based VO/VIO systems: it attains the best average ATE while running up to 1.77 times faster and using less GPU memory. Compared to classical optimization-based VIO systems, our approach maintains competitive trajectory accuracy while substantially reducing computational load."}

Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schrödinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients."}

The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range.

Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for.

Dissipation and pumping are introduced via local linear Lindblad jump operators and treated exactly using the third--quantization / Majorana covariance formalism. Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization. Our results highlight Liouvillian rapidities as compact, experimentally relevant diagnostics of relaxation and sensitivity in engineered open quantum lattices."}

We performed PSF-fitting photometry for sources in NIRCam (F200W and F444W) and MIRI (F770W and F1500W) and constructed UV to IR SEDs for sources within the central region of the cluster by using HST photometry from oMEGACat (Haberle et al. 2024b). None of the SEDs of reliably measured sources within this region resembles the SEDs computed from models of Pesce et al. 2021 for IMBHs accreting from intracluster medium at low rates. Our JWST limits place constraints on combinations of IMBH mass and accretion efficiency, either due to the amount of material available to be accreted, or due to the fraction of accreting matter that actually falls into the IMBH. Our non-detection then does not contradict the mass range of the IMBH inferred from the fast moving stars. We discuss these constraints in the context of the model of Pesce et al. 2021. We find that JWST limits are more restrictive than the existing radio limits for IMBH masses $\\lesssim 20,000 M_{\\odot}$. It is also possible that the faint IMBH emission is dominated by the light of a nearby star.

The growing oscillations in the spectral representation (which would be present with a naive use of the Fourier transform) are controlled by spatially truncating the hyperbolic Green's function itself.

We develop a framework based on synthesis operators associated with input and state trajectories. A key advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require the state derivative and uses continuous-time data directly without sampling or filtering. First, systems compatible with given data are described by the synthesis operators into which data trajectories are embedded. Next, we characterize data informativity properties for system identification and for stabilization. Finally, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for informativity for quadratic stabilization in the presence of process noise. This condition is formulated as linear matrix inequalities by exploiting the finite-rank structure of the synthesis operators."}

The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways -- a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data."}

Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies."}

Based on the principle of circular motion, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, particularly under large inter-platform distances. This phenomenon is even obvious for linearized kinematics, because cumulative linearization errors significantly degrade precision. In virtual reality (VR) applications, this manifests as substantial positional errors in 6-DoF controller tracking during rapid rotations of the head-mounted display. The linearization errors introduce drift in the estimate and render the estimator inconsistent. In the field of odometry, IMU preintegration is proposed as a kinematic observation to enable efficient relinearization, thus mitigate linearized error. Building on this theory, we propose dual preintegration, a novel observation integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms. This method serves as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative state and supports efficient relinearization. We also perform observability analysis of the state and analytically formulate the accordingly null space. Algorithm evaluation encompasses both simulations and real-world experiments. Multiple nonlinear rotations on the reference platform are simulated to compare the precision of the proposed method with that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms.

The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58.

It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit."}

XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016.

This paper presents an alternative paradigm: a sampling-based optimization framework that utilizes a GPU-accelerated physics simulator as its world model. We demonstrate that this approach can solve complex bimanual manipulation tasks in the presence of static obstacles.

We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moiré bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized \"chiral-flat\" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moiré superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ansätze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first \"case study\". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states.

Moreover, we provide detailed analysis of the convergence of these Krylov subspace methods. Specifically, for the symmetric case, we prove the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded in the open interval (1/2, 3/2), which results in a linear convergence rate of the PCG method.

High-order differential operators are constructed locally for arbitrary node distributions using linear combinations of anisotropic basis functions, formulated to ensure the exact reproduction of polynomial fields up to the specified p order. A dynamic p-refinement strategy is developed to refine (increase) or de-refine (decrease) the polynomial order used to approximate derivatives at each node. A new refinement indicator for mesh-free methods is proposed, based on local error estimates of the Laplacian operator, and is incorporated into the solution procedure at minimal added computational cost. Based on this error indicator, a refinement criterion is established to locally adjust the polynomial order p for the solution. The proposed adaptive mesh-free scheme is then applied to a range of canonical PDEs, and its potential is demonstrated in two-dimensional simulations of a compressible reacting flow in porous media. For the test cases studied, the proposed method exhibits potential to save up to 50% of computational costs while maintaining the specified level of accuracy. The results confirm that the developed p-adaptive high-order mesh-free method effectively captures highly non-linear regions where high-order approximation is necessary and reduces computational costs compared to the non-adaptive method, preserving high accuracy and solution stability."}

This can yield a blue shifted complex of absorption features in the region of $6.61-6.64$ keV. We use the photoionization code {\\sc pion} to test how varying the ionizing spectrum affects the detectability and interpretation of these features. We base these ionizing spectral energy distributions on GX~13$+$1 to represent a bright thermally dominated spectrum; 4U 1735$-$44 representing a harder, fainter LMXB spectrum; and MAXI J1820$+$070 representing a black hole LMXB spectrum completely dominated by Comptonized emission.

In particular, the discretization with tensor-product B-splines or NURBS of degree $p$ on a mesh with $n$ elements per parametric direction leads to symmetric positive-definite systems of the form $K\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{F}$, where the matrix bandwidth and condition number scale unfavorably with both $p$ and spatial dimension $d$. To address the computational challenges posed by such systems, especially in three-dimensional or high-order scenarios, Krylov subspace methods with specialized preconditioners become essential. This paper investigates the efficacy of algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioners tailored for IgA-based discretizations, with a focus on performance in modern high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Leveraging the Parallel Sparse Computation Toolkit (PSCToolkit), we explore distributed-memory and GPU-accelerated strategies for solving large-scale problems. The study assesses algorithmic efficiency and scalability across a range of benchmark tests. The results demonstrate that AMG preconditioners can achieve robust and scalable performance, confirming their potential as practical solvers for large IgA systems in engineering and scientific applications."}

Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Nuclear weak-interaction rates are known to exert a prominent effect in the late-stages of stellar collapse. Despite their importance, most studies to date on core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have focused primarily on the effects of electron captures, generally neglecting $β$ decay contributions. In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $β$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $β$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $β$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity. It is expected that these new rates could help us constrain the model uncertainties related to weak-interaction processes, improving the prediction of antineutrino signal during the final stages of stellar death and potentially influencing the late-stage evolution of massive stars."}

The proposed approach constructs high-order shape functions as linear combinations of standard finite element basis functions defined on a local trivial sub-triangulation of each element. This refinement is used solely for the construction of the shape functions and does not affect the final number of degrees of freedom. The resulting finite element space includes polynomials of the desired order and preserves conformity across elements. Consequently, the method inherits the convergence properties of the finite element framework under suitable mesh assumptions. Numerical experiments confirm the expected rates of convergence."}

Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released."}

This method employs an alternating iterative scheme, where each iteration entails solving two systems of equations with symmetric real coefficient matrices. This design is intended to reduce the high computational costs associated with complex arithmetic. Theoretical analysis shows that the upper bound of the convergence rate depends only on the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrices, as well as the iteration parameters. When the eigenvalues satisfy certain conditions, the method guarantees convergence for any positive iteration parameter. Building on this insight, we developed the preconditioned lopsided HSS iteration method (PLHSS). Theoretical results demonstrate that PLHSS exhibits superior convergence properties compared to the original method. Additionally, we derived the optimal parameters for the new approaches and corresponding optimal convergence rate. Furthermore, we derive the PLHSS preconditioner on the basis of the iterative method. The eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are well-clustered, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal with a specific inner product. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the preconditioned GMRES and COCG methods. LHSS iteration methods and the relevant preconditioners show mesh size independent and parameter-insensitive convergence behavior for the test numerical examples."}

To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness."}

Extensive numerical experiments on 2D and 3D problems verify that our proposed solver exhibits superior robustness and efficiency, significantly surpassing the classical smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid method. Moreover, frequency domain analysis empirically confirms the essential complementarity between the smoother and the neural corrector."}

In this paper, we review key theoretical results in pseudospectral optimal control that have proven to be critical for a successful flight. Implementation details of flight demonstrations onboard NASA spacecraft are discussed along with emerging trends and techniques in both theory and practice. The 2011 launch of pseudospectral optimal control in embedded platforms is changing the way in which we see solutions to challenging control problems in aerospace and autonomous systems."}
