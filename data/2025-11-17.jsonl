We analyse the situations when the external conditions may change during the motion of the system and analyse two possibilities: (a) when the behaviour of the external conditions is known in advance; and (b) when the future changes of the external conditions are unknown but we can measure the current state and the current velocity of the external conditions, at every moment of time. We prove that in the case (a) the complexity of the motion algorithm is the same as in the case of constant external conditions; this generalises the result of \\cite{FGY}. In case (b) we introduce a new concept of a reaction mechanism which allows to take into account unexpected and unpredictable changes in the environment. A reaction mechanism is mathematically an infinitesimal lifting function on a fibre bundle, a nonlinear generalisation of the classical concept of an Ehresmann connection. We illustrate these notions by examples which show that nonlinear infinitesimal lifting function (reaction mechanisms) appear naturally, are inevitable and ubiquitous."}

The polarization levels seen throughout our observations are on average 0.87% +/- 0.05% higher than those of any Type Ib SN~yet studied, suggesting either that it is the most asymmetric of the sample, or if all SNe Ib have similar asymmetry, that it is viewed at a more optimum angle. Significant continuum polarization indicates that the photosphere exhibited a global departure from spherical symmetry at the level of 10%-40% at the earliest times (days 0--40), which decreased to 0%-20% by days 57--90. During the early photospheric phase, the ejecta maintained a near-constant orientation of 12°-20° on the sky, as shown by the dominant axis in the Stokes q-u plane. Polarization signatures in the Fe II λλλ4924, 5018, 5169 lines shared this axis. Meanwhile, high levels of polarization associated with the He I lines traced distinct q-u loops with a dramatic rotation away from the dominant axis, indicating that the early-time ejecta were also characterized by hot, fast, helium-rich material concentrated near the poles. At day 295, during the transition to the nebular phase, a new, highly elongated structure became prominent in the ejecta, with an axis orthogonal to the dominant axis that defined the photospheric phase. This dual-axis geometry may link SN 2012au's high luminosity and asymmetric structure to a magnetar powering mechanism."}

Simulating directly in the thermodynamic limit, we explore the relaxation process near the critical point with two types of initial states: a fully polarized state and a product state with a small magnetization. For the fully polarized state, the magnetization shows a power law scaling $M\\propto τ^{-β/(νz)}$ in the imaginary-time evolution, from which both the critical point and critical exponent can be determined with high accuracy. For the nearly paramagnetic state, the relaxation process exhibits a behavior of $M\\propto τ^θ$ with $θ=0.1958$ being the critical initial-slip exponent, which is in good agreement with that obtained from the dynamic scaling of the self-correlation in quantum Monte Carlo method. These universal features emerge well before the system converges to the ground state, demonstrating the efficiency of imaginary-time evolution for probing quantum criticality. Our results demonstrate that iPEPS can serve as a robust and scalable method for studying dynamical critical phenomena in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems."}

Specifically, for any tolerance $η> 0$, there exist parameters $λ$ (discount rate) and $t$ (time horizon) such that trajectories remain within an $η$-neighborhood of the global minimizers after some finite time $τ$. This convergence is achieved directly, without solving ergodic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.

This paper develops and applies a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze U.S. county-level mortality and suicide rates from 2010 to 2023. Applying a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure to each combination of sex and age grouping, the model captures spatial and temporal trends while incorporating mental health surveillance data and socio-economic indicators. We first assess socio-economic covariates in predicting suicide. While the results vary considerably by age and sex, we find that the county-wide levels of educational attainment, housing prices, marriage rates, racial composition, household size, and poor mental health days all have significant relationships with suicide rates. We next consider the impact of various mental health indicators on all-cause and suicide-specific mortality and find that the strongest effects are observed in younger populations. The spatial and temporal correlation structures reveal substantial regional clustering and time-consistent trends in both all-cause mortality and suicide rates, supporting the use of spatio-temporal methods. Our findings highlight the value of integrating mental health surveillance data into mortality models to better identify emerging risk areas and vulnerable populations. This approach has the potential to inform public health policy, resource allocation, and targeted interventions aimed at reducing disparities in mortality and suicide across U.S. communities."}

In the current work, we propose first and second-order kinematic evolution models, where the state-space vector includes not only the dipolar source activity but also its velocity and acceleration. Compared to our previous study, this motion model yields smoother and more physically plausible estimates of brain activity even when the measurement noise is high, for both superficial and deep sources.

Our simulation study, which involves thalamic and cortical activity in the somatosensory region, demonstrates that accurate estimation and tracking of both superficial and deep brain activity are feasible."}

The measurement uses data collected in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment in 2017, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 301$^{-1}$. An algorithm to identify and cluster the charged decay daughters of b hadrons is developed for this analysis, which facilitates the exposure of the gluon radiation pattern of b jets using iterative Cambridge-Aachen declustering. The soft-drop-groomed jet radius, $R_\\mathrm{g}$, and momentum balance, $z_\\mathrm{g}$, of b quark jets are presented. These observables can be used to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics predictions that account for mass effects. Because the b hadron is partially reconstructed from its charged decay daughters, only charged particles are used for the jet substructure studies. In addition, a jet fragmentation function, $z_\\text{b,ch}$, is measured, which is defined as the distribution of the ratio of the transverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) of the partially reconstructed b hadron with respect to the charged-particle component of the jet $p_\\mathrm{T}$. The substructure variable distributions are unfolded to the charged-particle level. The b jet substructure is compared to the substructure of jets in an inclusive jet sample that is dominated by light-quark and gluon jets in order to assess the role of the b quark mass. A strong suppression of emissions at small $R_\\mathrm{g}$ values is observed for b jets when compared to inclusive jets, consistent with the dead-cone effect. The measurement is also compared with theoretical predictions from Monte Carlo event generators. This is the first substructure measurement of b jets that clusters together the b hadron decay daughters."}

In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, it is expected that they underwent a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal mass ratios, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to either a stellar merger or a final binary with a very short orbital period. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. With the aid of detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether fully non-conservative mass transfer, where mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two of the Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from the standard isotropic re-emission model, which assumes mass loss from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss model, without the need for fine-tuning, reproduces the observed orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well across a wide range of initial conditions. This scenario, therefore, offers a plausible formation pathway for these systems. We speculate that orbital widening during mass loss could result from the unequal Roche-lobe sizes of the components and eruptive mass loss driven by the donor's high-opacity subsurface layers. Similar mass loss may also be relevant for all other classes of post-mass-transfer binaries that face analogous evolutionary challenges, including Gaia neutron star and white dwarf systems, binaries hosting stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries."}

This provides, in a simplified setting, a rigorous derivation of the slow thermalization predicted by Lenard-Balescu theory. Our approach relies on a rigorous Dyson expansion in terms of Feynman diagrams and on a novel renormalization scheme that removes leading recollisions. The main technical challenge is to control the effect of phase-space filamentation within the diagrams, which we achieve by combining phase mixing and hypoelliptic regularity. Although restricted to a simplified model, our analysis offers new insight into Lenard-Balescu thermalization: notably, the renormalization appears to transform free propagators into hypoelliptic ones, providing a key mechanism that compensates for filamentation."}

Optical conductivity reveals an anisotropic but conventional metallic response with low scattering rates and a single sharp infrared-active phonon mode at $396$ cm$^{-1}$ ($49$ meV).

We further specialize our analysis to some radially symmetric geometries, enabling a more precise characterization of bifurcations in the spectrum.

While signal decays typically involve just a few charged particles, a single proton-proton collision produces hundreds of tracks, with charged particle information dominating the event size. To address this imbalance, a suite of inclusive isolation tools have been developed, including both classical methods and a novel Inclusive Multivariate Isolation (IMI) algorithm. The IMI unifies the key strengths of classical isolation techniques and is designed to robustly handle diverse decay topologies and kinematics, enabling efficient reconstruction of decay chains with varying final-state multiplicities. It consistently outperforms traditional methods, with superior background rejection and high signal efficiency across diverse channels and event multiplicities. By retaining only the most relevant particles in each event, the method achieves a 45 % reduction in data size while preserving full physics performance, selecting signal particles with 99% efficiency. We also validate IMI on Run 3 data, confirming its robustness under real data-taking conditions. In the long term, IMI could provide a fast, lightweight front-end to support more compute-intensive selection strategies in the high-multiplicity environment of the High-Luminosity LHC."}

Understanding the motion of this gas provides critical insight into processes such as mergers, turbulence, and energy dissipation in the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. The Coma cluster is a nearby, massive system long suspected to be dynamically disturbed. Previous high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the XRISM mission revealed bulk motions in the cluster core and southern regions. Here we present new XRISM Resolve observations of a northern region in Coma, which reveal a coherent velocity gradient of nearly $530 km/s across the cluster from south to north. We find that the hot gas in this northern region exhibits modest line-of-sight motions and uniform thermodynamic properties, indicating relatively mild local disturbances. The consistent levels of turbulence throughout the cluster suggest that the energy from a past merger has been distributed on large scales. These findings provide compelling evidence for an off-axis merger event and demonstrate how high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can uncover subtle dynamical signatures in the ICM, offering important constraints for simulations of cluster evolution."}

Our method relies on a boundary integral formulation, semi-discretized in space using a Galerkin approach with appropriately chosen basis functions, s.t. convergence is achieved as the particle size vanishes rather than by increasing the number of basis functions. Since the computation of the Galerkin matrix involves double integration over particles, the method can become computationally demanding when the number of obstacles is large. To address this, we also derive a simplified model and consider the Born approximation to improve computational efficiency. For the high-order models, we provide an error analysis, supported and validated by numerical experiments."}

We measure the properties of key emission features, namely those at 6300, 7300, and 7774 angstroms (associated with [O I], [Ca II]/[O II], and O I, respectively), and find that SLSNe exhibit much wider spectral diversity than normal SNe Ic, primarily in the line ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, which is highly sensitive to ejecta ionization. Some events exhibit weak [O I] and a clear [O II] contribution to the 7300 angstrom feature, enhancing the ratio, along with [O III] lines at 4363 and 5007 angstroms. Other SLSNe show weak or no lines of ionized oxygen. Moreover, we find that the population exhibits decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ over time, while a few outliers instead display sustained high or increasing ratios for extended periods. The ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ is also correlated with the rise and decline times of the light curves, with slower events exhibiting higher ionization, the first robust connection between early light curve and late-time spectral properties, likely due to the magnetar's impact: slower-evolving SLSNe are generally powered by engines with longer spin-down timescales, which deposit more energy at later phases. Among the events with decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, SLSNe with high ionization are on average powered by magnetars with higher thermalized spin-down power, a correlation that is most significant for events with $M_{\\rm ej}\\lesssim12$ M$_{\\odot}$. The ionization in the outliers with increasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ may be due to late CSM interaction. $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ and its evolution are therefore key diagnostics of SLSN engines and progenitor mass loss."}

The reserve level of each line is modeled using a diffusion approximation, with the insurer's objective being to maximize the weighted total discounted dividends paid until the first ruin time. We obtain the value function and the optimal strategies in closed form. We then prove that the optimal dividend payout strategy for bounded dividend rates is of threshold type, while for unbounded dividend rates it is of barrier type. The optimal combination of proportional and excess-of-loss reinsurance is shown to be pure excess-of-loss reinsurance. We also show that the optimal level of risk ceded to the reinsurer decreases as the aggregate reserve level increases. The optimal capital injection strategy involves transferring reserves to prevent the ruin of one line. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate these optimal strategies."}

Starting from a high-fidelity multiphysics percolation model, describing fluid flow, solute transport, solid, liquid reactions, and heat exchange within the coffee bed, we derive a reduced forward operator mapping controllable brewing parameters to the concentrations of the main chemical species in the cup. From a mathematical standpoint, we formalize the structural requirements for the local solvability of inverse problems, providing a minimal analytical condition for the existence of a (local) inverse map: continuous differentiability of the forward operator and a locally constant, nondegenerate Jacobian rank. Under these assumptions, the Constant Rank Theorem ensures that the image of the forward operator is a smooth embedded manifold on which well-defined local right-inverses exist.\n  Extensive experiments, including off-grid validation, show that the learned inverse map accurately reconstructs brewing temperature, grind size, and powder composition. The resulting framework combines rigorous analytical guarantees with modern data-driven methods, providing a principled and computationally efficient solution to the inverse extraction problem and enabling personalised brewing, recipe optimisation, and integration into smart coffee-machine systems."}

The X-ray surface brightness profile perpendicular to the filament is detected at a $5.5σ$ level. Weak-lensing (WL) analysis using the Subaru/HSC-SSP Survey archive data strongly supports the two mass components.

The main axis of the projected halo distribution is more likely to align with the direction of the main cluster than to be oriented perpendicularly. Similar X-ray distributions have been identified in the literature on numerical simulations. The filamentary structure forms in the following manner: as the gas is stripped by ram pressure near the pericenter, it gets dragged by tidal rotation. Once free from this rotation, the gas moves inertially in a direction parallel to the tangential velocity at the pericenter. The comma-shaped gas, with tails pointing in the opposite direction to the main cluster, is also formed by the current tidal rotation as it moves away from the main cluster. This warrants us that, although it is sometimes thought based on the X-ray morphology alone that the tail is pointing in the opposite direction to the merger motion, this is not necessarily the case. The information of the X-ray filamentary remnant from the cluster merger, together with the 2D WL shear data, provides constraints on the merger parameters, indicating an infalling velocity of approximately $1000\\, {\\rm km\\, s^{-1}}$ and an impact parameter of $0.9$ Mpc."}

Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $Ω=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable."}

In this work, we present a hybrid analytical and numerical framework for evaluating the geometric measure of entanglement. The method combines a Gauss Seidel fixed point iteration with a controlled perturbative correction scheme. We make the coupled nonlinear eigenstructure explicit by proving the equal multiplier stationarity identity, which states that at the optimum all block Lagrange multipliers coincide with the squared fidelity between the target state and its closest separable approximation. A normalization-preserving linearization is then derived by projecting the dynamics onto the local tangent spaces, yielding a well-defined first order correction and an explicit scalar shift in the eigenvalue. Furthermore, we establish a monotonic block ascent property the squared overlap between the evolving product state and the target state increases at every iteration, remains bounded by unity, and converges to a stationary value. The resulting hybrid solver reproduces the exact optimum for standard three qubit benchmarks, obtaining squared-overlap values of one-half for the Greenberger Horne Zeilinger (GHZ\\(_3\\)) state and four-ninths for the W\\(_3\\) state, with smooth monotonic convergence."}

The equations are analysed using a general auxiliary field method, introduced here, which provides practical criteria for showing that a given operator is (semi)-Green-hyperbolic. The method goes beyond what is achieved in existing analyses of deformed equations, which for example place restrictions on the magnetic moment and electromagnetic potential that can be coupled to a Proca field. The theories considered can be quantized following a common pattern and all the examples treated in this work admit Hadamard states on any globally hyperbolic spacetime.\n  As an application, the Proca-Klein-Gordon system is used to develop a measurement scheme sensitive to the Proca polarization, using a Klein-Gordon field as the probe.

Unfortunately, these results cannot properly justify the superior performance of these methods, as they could not beat the convergence rate of vanilla Euclidean SGD. We resolve this important open problem by developing a new unified convergence analysis under the structured smoothness and gradient noise assumption. In particular, our results indicate that non-Euclidean SGD (i) can exploit the sparsity or low-rank structure of the upper bounds on the Hessian and gradient noise, (ii) can provably benefit from popular algorithmic tools such as extrapolation or momentum variance reduction, and (iii) can match the state-of-the-art convergence rates of adaptive and more complex optimization algorithms such as AdaGrad and Shampoo."}

Using data from Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of Vela X-1, we perform a polarization analysis of Vela X-1 using a triple power-law spectral model absorbed by varying column densities, successfully isolating two physically distinct orthogonal polarized components. The first polarized component corresponds to emission from the accretion mound surface that is not obscured by the wind clumps, with its polarization degree (PD) exceeding 30\\%. In specific phase intervals, the PD reaches \\(50.9 \\pm 10.7\\%\\). This marks the first detection of such highly polarized neutron star emission in an XRP. The second polarized component likely originates from complex physical processes within or near the accretion mound, with its PD showing a potential negative correlation with column density. Furthermore, by rotating the predicted polarization angle (PA) of the first polarized component by 90$^\\circ$, we successfully achieve separate fitting and simultaneous fitting of the two orthogonal polarization states using the rotating vector model (RVM)."}

One motivation for our work was the hypothesis that a smaller intrinsic volume of the state space compared to the corresponding intrinsic volume of the mentioned polytope could rule out such an inscription. While our computations of these two intrinsic volumes do not lead to this conclusion, they nonetheless provide fundamental insights into the geometric structure of quantum state spaces. In particular, we show that these quantities can be used to rule out the existence of some unit-vector ``configurations'' (though not the one formed by the bases vectors of a complete set of mutually unbiased bases)."}

By re-formulating the global cost in a bilinear form, we derive local subgraph problems whose gradients approximately align with the global descent direction via an SVD-based test on the $ZC$ matrix. This leads to an iterate-and-embed scheme over disjoint 1-hop neighborhoods that preserves feasibility by construction (positivity and budget) and scales to large geometric graphs. For objectives that depend on pairwise eigenvalue differences $h(λ_i-λ_j)$, we obtain a quadratic upper bound in the degree vector, which motivates a ``warm-start'' by degree-regularization. The warm start uses randomized gossip to estimate global average degree, accelerating subsequent local descent while maintaining decentralization, and realizing $\\sim95\\%{}$ of the performance with respect to centralized optimization. We further introduce a learning-based proposer that predicts one-shot edge updates on maximal 1-hop embeddings, yielding immediate objective reductions. Together, these components form a practical, modular pipeline for spectrum-aware weight tuning that preserves constraints and applies across a broader class of whole-spectrum costs."}

The dataset combines observations from the MeerKAT, Nançay, Lovell, and Murriyang telescopes, spanning a total baseline of approximately 14 years. The glitch occurred on MJD~59942(17), with a measured fractional spin frequency step of $Δν_g / ν=1.15(13) \\times 10^{-12}$. This event represents the third glitch detected in a MSP, following those in PSRs B1821$-$24A and J0613$-$0200. Although smaller in amplitude than the previous two, the glitch in PSR J0900$-$3144 is of a comparable order of magnitude. The updated MSP glitch rate is $2.5(1)\\times 10^{-3}$ glitches per pulsar per year, which suggests it is likely current PTAs will detect another MSP glitch within five years. Using simulations, we demonstrate that such small glitches can go undetected, especially in short datasets such as those from new PTAs, and can bias the inferred achromatic noise model parameters, potentially leading to the down-weighting of the pulsar in gravitational wave background searches."}

Despite its smooth dependence on the refractive index at the PDE level, the corresponding spectral map from material parameters to eigenpairs may exhibit non-smooth or bifurcating behavior. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework identifying sufficient conditions for such non-smooth spectral behavior in the ITP on general domains. We further specialize our analysis to some radially symmetric geometries, enabling a more precise characterization of bifurcations in the spectrum. Computationally, we formulate the ITP as a parametric, discrete, nonlinear eigenproblem and use a match-based adaptive contour eigensolver to accurately and efficiently track eigenvalue trajectories under parameter variation. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and reveal novel non-smooth spectral effects."}

The proposed approach enables adaptive control and cooperative behavior of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a cognitive AI platform, where each agent learns optimal energy management and navigation policies from dynamic environmental states. We extend the standard DDPG architecture with a belief-state representation derived from Bayesian filtering, allowing for robust decision-making in partially observable environments. In this paper, for the Gaussian case, we numerically compare the performance of policies derived from DDPG to optimal policies for discretized versions of the original continuous problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the POMDP-DDPG-based swarm control model significantly improves mission success rates and energy efficiency compared to baseline methods. The developed framework supports distributed learning and decision coordination across multiple agents, providing a foundation for scalable cognitive swarm autonomy. The outcomes of this research contribute to the advancement of energy-aware control algorithms for intelligent multi-agent systems and can be applied in security, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection scenarios."}

The EG space employed here, originally proposed in [1], differs from traditional EG methods: it enriches the first-order continuous Galerkin (CG) space with piecewise constants along edges in two dimensions or on faces in three dimensions, rather than with elementwise polynomials. Within this framework, the gradient and divergence are modified to incorporate the edge/face enrichment, while the curl remains applied only to the CG component, an inherent feature that makes the space particularly suitable for the rotational form. The proposed EG method achieves pressure robustness through a velocity reconstruction operator. We establish existence, uniqueness under a small-data assumption, and convergence of the method, and confirm its effectiveness by numerical experiments."}

Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray--only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane. This offset, consistent with the observed harder spectrum of short GRBs, may serve as a useful diagnostic for investigating the progenitor as larger samples are available."}

We propose a quantum spectral method with polylogarithmic complexity for solving non-periodic boundary value problems with arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our method extends the recently proposed approach by Liu et al. (2025), in which periodic problems are discretised using truncated Fourier series. In such spectral methods, the discretisation of boundary value problems with constant coefficients leads to a set of algebraic equations in the Fourier space. We implement the respective diagonal solution operator by first approximating it with a polynomial and then quantum encoding the polynomial. The mapping between the physical and Fourier spaces is accomplished using the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). To impose zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, we double the domain size and reflect all physical fields antisymmetrically. The respective reflection matrix defines the quantum sine transform (QST) by pre- and post-multiplying with the QFT. For non-zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, the solution is decomposed into a boundary-conforming and a homogeneous part. The homogenous part is determined by solving a problem with a suitably modified forcing vector. We illustrate the basic approach with a Dirichlet-Poisson problem and demonstrate its generality by applying it to a fractional stochastic PDE for modelling spatial random fields. We discuss the circuit implementation of the proposed approach and provide numerical evidence confirming its polylogarithmic complexity."}

Anyhow, the theoretical expectations need to be corroborated by clear observations. Despite the increasing number of detections at different energies, the contamination of other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from stellar winds only, unless one selects objects younger than a few million years, namely before stars start to explode inside clusters. I will review the results obtained with gamma-ray data towards a few massive young star clusters and discuss what implications these result have, especially concerning their contribution to the bulk of Galactic CRs."}

We analyse the situations when the external conditions may change during the motion of the system and analyse two possibilities: (a) when the behaviour of the external conditions is known in advance; and (b) when the future changes of the external conditions are unknown but we can measure the current state and the current velocity of the external conditions, at every moment of time. We prove that in the case (a) the complexity of the motion algorithm is the same as in the case of constant external conditions; this generalises the result of \\cite{FGY}. In case (b) we introduce a new concept of a reaction mechanism which allows to take into account unexpected and unpredictable changes in the environment. A reaction mechanism is mathematically an infinitesimal lifting function on a fibre bundle, a nonlinear generalisation of the classical concept of an Ehresmann connection. We illustrate these notions by examples which show that nonlinear infinitesimal lifting function (reaction mechanisms) appear naturally, are inevitable and ubiquitous."}
