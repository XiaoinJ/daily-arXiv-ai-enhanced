Abstract: We define various notions of locality for *-automorphisms of the algebra of observables for an infinitely extended quantum spin system and study their relationship. In particular, we show that the ubiquitous characterization which arises from the Lieb-Robinson bound implies but is not equivalent to continuity with respect to the natural Fréchet topology of almost local observables, which is a non-commutative analog of the Schwartz space.

Abstract: We develop a rigorous topological theory of anomalies on the lattice, which are obstructions to gauging global symmetries and the existence of trivial symmetric states. We also construct $Ω$-spectra of a class of invertible states and quantum cellular automata, which allows us to classify both anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases up to blend equivalence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the spin-1/2 $J_1-J_2$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field by combining large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with self-consistent spin-wave theory. The resulting field-coupling phase diagram reveals that quantum fluctuations stabilize coplanar order across the entire parameter range, giving rise to a characteristic sequence of magnetization plateaux. Near the quantum-spin-liquid window $0.06 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.14$, which extends to magnetic field $B \sim J_1$, we identify overlapping $m = 1/3$ and $m = 1/2$ plateaux - a distinctive hallmark of the system's proximity to the low-field spin-liquid regime. The excellent quantitative agreement between DMRG and self-consistent one-loop spin-wave calculations demonstrates that semiclassical approaches can reliably capture and parameterize the plateau phases of triangular quantum antiferromagnets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) exhibits hysteresis in resistance while undergoing a thermally driven insulator-metal transition (IMT). Understanding the nonequilibrium effects in resistance is of great interest, as VO$_2$ is a strong candidate for brain-inspired computing, which is more energy efficient for AI tasks compared to traditional computing. Accurate models of the connection between microscopic and macroscopic transport properties and microscopic imaging of VO$_2$ will allow us to better utilize VO$_2$ in future applications. However, predictions of macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ that quantitatively match observations using spatially resolved data have not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate an accurate prediction of the macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ throughout the entire temperature range of interest, by developing a multiscale resistor network model incorporating the assumption of fractal sub-pixel structure of the optical data, where the configuration of insulating and metallic domains within each pixel are drawn from the random field Ising model near criticality. This strongly indicates that the observed fractal, power law structure of metallic and insulating domains extends down to much smaller length scales than the current record for experimental resolution of this system, and that the two-dimensional random field Ising model near criticality is a suitable model for describing the metal and insulator patches of VO$_2$ down to scales that approach the unit cell.

Abstract: The metallic kagome compound Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ has attracted attention as a candidate platform where geometric frustration and itinerant electrons may cooperate to stabilize a quantum-disordered magnetic ground state. Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ hosts an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, placing it among the rare metallic kagome systems proximate to a quantum spin liquid.

Abstract: The fuzzy-sphere regularization is an emerging numerical and theoretical technique for studying conformal field theories (CFTs). In this paper, we apply it to the $O(N)$ vector model, one of the most prominent theories for critical behavior in three space-time dimensions. We construct a model that realizes the $O(N)$ Wilson-Fisher and free-scalar CFTs for general $N$. For $N=2,3,4$, we present numerical evidence including the operator spectra and correlation functions in agreement with conformal symmetry and conformal bootstrap results.

Abstract: We present a novel pairing mechanism for superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems, which often have both localised and itinerant charge carriers. An effective anisotropic interaction between the itinerant particles originates from the fluctuations in the crystal field associated with virtual hopping of the localised particles, a process that is also responsible for the Kondo exchange. Interestingly, this interaction is \emph{attractive} for charge transfer insulators such as cuprates. Considering a simple toy model for cuprates, without the antiferromagnetic exchange, this interaction leads to the correct d-wave superconducting gap, thus demonstrating its relevance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantized Thouless pumps in periodic systems, set by Chern numbers or Wannier-center winding, is by now fairly well established, whereas its quasi-periodic extensions still require further clarification. Here, we develop a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in continuous models with spacetime quasi-periodicity, applicable to arbitrary spatial dimensions. Within this framework, the bulk pumping turns out to be governed by an emergent long wave-length effective potential. Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data. These proposals are corroborated by simulations of one- and two-dimensional continuous moiré-type spacetime quasi-periodic lattices, which exhibit stable, localized, directional drift in excellent agreement with the theory.

Abstract: We derive the self-consistent random phase approximations (sc-RPA) from the projective truncation approximation (PTA) for the equation of motion of two-time Green's function. The obtained sc-RPA applies to arbitrary temperature and recovers the Rowe's formalism at zero temperature. The PTA formalism not only rationalize Rowe's formula, but also provides a general framework to extend sc-RPA. We implement the sc-RPA calculation for the one-dimensional spinless fermion model in the parameter regime of disordered ground state, with the N-representability constraints enforced. The obtained ground state energy, correlation function, and density spectral function agree well with existing results. The features of the Luttinger liquid ground state and the continuum/bound state in the spectral function are well captured. We discuss several issues concerning the approximations made in RPAs, difficulties of RPA for symmetric state, and the static component problem of PTA.

Abstract: Excitons and their complexes govern optical-related behaviors in semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have elucidated the light-matter interac- tion mediated by quasi-steady excitonic complexes within a monolayer of the prototypical two- dimensional (2D) semiconductor WSe2. Under continuous incident light, we have observed the generation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, encompassing ground and excited state excitons, trions, as well as their intricate interplay. We further show spectral evidence of elec- tronic excitation states within the background of quasi-steady excitonic complexes, characterized by valence band (VB) effective mass renormalization, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the formation of an excitonic gap near the Fermi level (EF ) of the conduction band (CB), and intervalley excitonic band folding. Our findings not only unveil a quasi-steady excitonic complex background for the creation of diverse electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors but also offer new insights into the role of excitons in the charge density wave (CDW) formation mechanism and facilitate the advancement of correlated electronic state engineering based on the coupling between electrons and excitonic complexes in a quasi-equilibrium state.

Abstract: Perovskite ruthenates are fascinating playgrounds for exploring topological spin textures, but generally rely on extrinsic mechanisms to trigger the noncoplanar states. Here we report the discovery of an emergent chiral spin crystal phase in (111) SrRuO3 epitaxial films, characterized by a significant topological Hall effect and noncoplanar spin arrangements with different propagation vectors along two orthogonal directions. Instead of driven by the enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to broken inversion symmetry at heterointerfaces, this emergent state arises intrinsically from the interplay of dipolar interactions and magnetic frustration, leading to the stabilization of topological phases in much thicker films. These findings open a new pathway for creating and controlling the topological spin states in perovskites, with broad implications for spintronic device design.

Abstract: We use ultrafast optical spectroscopy to investigate the electronic and lattice dynamics of the charge-density wave (CDW) material 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ across various temperatures and pump fluences. We reveal a close relationship between the observed ultrafast dynamical processes and two characteristic temperatures: $T_{\rm CDW}$ ($\sim$202 K) and $T^*$ ($\sim$165 K). Two coherent phonon modes are identified: a high-frequency $A_{1g}$ mode ($ω_{1}$) and a lower-frequency $A_{1g}$ CDW amplitude mode ($ω_{2}$). In stark contrast to thermal melting, where phonons soften, the CDW amplitude mode exhibits anomalous hardening (frequency upshift) with increasing pump fluence. We establish this hardening as the direct signature of an ultrafast restoration of the bare lattice potential. The photoexcited carrier plasma screens the long-range electron-phonon interactions that drive the Peierls-like instability, effectively ``undressing" the soft phonon and driving its frequency toward the stiffer value of the unrenormalized lattice. Furthermore, an abrupt increase in the excited state buildup time above a critical pump fluence marks a sharp boundary to a photoinduced metastable metallic state. These findings demonstrate that the CDW order in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ is governed by a fragile, fluence-tunable competition between excitonic correlations and lattice dynamics.

Abstract: We study the exchange coupling in small Wigner crystals confined to one-dimensional space. In particular we concentrate on the simplest nontrivial case of two electrons in a box potential and calculate analytically the energy splitting between the lowest spatially symmetric and antisymmetric states, which is a relevant energy scale for the magnetic properties of the system. In the approximation of a fixed center of mass coordinate, the splitting decays exponentially with the square root of the distance between the electrons at the leading order. We show that the subleading exponential correction significantly increases the splitting and thus becomes crucial in order to describe correctly the exact numerical data for system sizes that are not astronomically large. Two methods of calculation of the energy splitting are developed. The first is based on the analysis of the exact solution that can be expressed in terms of the Whittaker functions. It applies at all values of the short-distance cutoff played by the width of one-dimensional wire that regularizes the Coulomb potential. The second method is based on the quasiclassical (or Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, which applies only for sufficiently large values of the cutoff. The two methods give identical result in the overlapping region. As a side result, our study gives the energy splitting in a triangular double well potential of inverse ``M'' shape.

Abstract: We point out that in the tilted Dirac cone materials the non-equilibrium (hot) electron relaxation with phonons is anisotropic in the Brillouin zone. It means that there is a preferential heating of the lattice degrees of freedom in the specific directions of the Brillouin zone, in particular, in the direction opposite to the tilt velocity in the model considered by us. This observation will have novel consequences: (1) With pump-probe spectroscopy applied to a given tilted Dirac cone material an anisotropic relaxation would lead to a transient anisotropic heating which can further lead to a transient Seebeck effect as transient thermal gradients would exist in the specific directions of the BZ, and (2) this direction of anisotropic heating can be controlled by controlling the direction of the tilt velocity which can be externally tuned by the application of an external pressure. We foresee novel applications of this effect in ultrafast sensor applications involving transient heating effects. This is equivalent to inducing a transient Seebeck effect by just shinning light on a tilted Dirac cone material!

Abstract: Lattice degrees of freedom (DoF) play a central role in correlated electron systems, strongly influencing the dynamics of the underlying charge carriers and spin excitations. In nickelates, understanding the role of lattice is essential to unravel the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degree of freedom in giving rise to various emergent phenomena reported recently. Here, we investigate the phononic DoF in a series of trilayer nickelates, namely Pr4-xLaxNi3O10 (where x = 0, 0.4, 1, 2, 3.6, and 4) using temperature and polarization dependent Raman scattering measurements. Our in-depth analysis of the phonon evolution with temperature and doping, gives interesting insights into the behaviour of these materials. All these systems undergo a metal-to-metal transition (TMMT), characterized by the development of intertwined spin and charge density waves, with the spin density wave preceding the charge density wave. These transitions manifest as pronounced anomalies in phonon self-energy parameters i.e. peak frequency and linewidth in the vicinity of the metal-to-metal transition. Several phonon modes show dramatic change (nearly an order of magnitude for some modes) in their softening rates across the TMMT, highlighting the sensitivity of the lattice dynamics to spin and charge order. These findings emphasize the crucial role of lattice DoF in mediating correlated ground states in layered nickelates.

Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo and numerical analytic continuation methods, we study the dynamic spin structure factor and the single-hole spectral function of a two-dimensional quantum magnet ($J$-$Q$ model) at its quantum phase transition separating Néel antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states. At this putative deconfined quantum-critical point, we find a broad continuum of spinon excitations that can be accounted for by the fermionic $π$-flux state; a known mean-field model for deconfined quantum criticality. We find that the best description of the two-spinon continuum is with a version of the model with a $2\times 2$ unit cell, reflecting non-trivial mutual statistics of spinons and anti-spinons. The single-hole spectral function can be described by the same spinon dispersion relation and an independently propagating holon. Thus, the system exhibits spin-charge separation and will likely evolve into an extended holon metal phase at finite doping.

Abstract: An excitonic insulator (EI) is a charge-neutral bosonic condensate of spontaneously formed electron-hole pairs. Exotic quantum phenomena such as dissipationless charge neutral transport and huge potential for optoelectronic applications have led to an extensive search for intrinsic bulk materials that are EIs at ambient pressure without sophisticated device fabrication. The narrow gap semimetal Ta2NiSe5 has been proposed as a rare example of an intrinsic EI, but its ground state has remained controversial since the EI phase transition is accompanied by a structural distortion. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to present microscopic evidence that supports an excitonic origin of the insulating phase in Ta2NiSe5. First, we find that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk structural distortion is absent suggesting that the structural distortion is not the primary origin of insulating ground state. Second, the insulating gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles which indicates that charge correlations are important in producing the insulating gap. Finally, the decay length of the in-gap states at the puddles shows similar value to the estimated size of the exciton wavefunction from previous photoemission studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ta2NiSe5 is an EI and may be a versatile platform to study the physics of bosonic condensates in solid-state system at ambient conditions.

Abstract: For the task with complicated manipulation in unstructured environments, traditional hand-coded methods are ineffective, while reinforcement learning can provide more general and useful policy. Although the reinforcement learning is able to obtain impressive results, its stability and reliability is hard to guarantee, which would cause the potential safety threats. Besides, the transfer from simulation to real world also will lead in unpredictable situations. To enhance the safety and reliability of robots, we introduce the force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning. Force and tactual sensation play key roles in robotic dynamic control and human-robot interaction. We demonstrate that the force-based reinforcement learning method can be more adaptive to environment, especially in sim-to-real transfer. Experimental results show in object pushing task, our strategy is safer and more efficient in both simulation and real world, thus it holds prospects for a wide variety of robotic applications.

Abstract: We present VIGS-SLAM, a visual-inertial 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that achieves robust real-time tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction. Although recent 3DGS-based SLAM methods achieve dense and photorealistic mapping, their purely visual design degrades under motion blur, low texture, and exposure variations. Our method tightly couples visual and inertial cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly refining camera poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization, time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates. Experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://vigs-slam.github.io

Abstract: World models have gained significant attention as a promising approach for autonomous driving. By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Information gathering in large-scale or time-critical scenarios (e.g., environmental monitoring, search and rescue) requires broad coverage within limited time budgets, motivating the use of multi-agent systems. These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as "intent" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/marmotlab/AID.

Abstract: As robots become more adaptable, responsive, and capable of interacting with humans, the design of effective human-robot collaboration becomes critical. Yet, this design process is typically led by monodisciplinary approaches, often overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and the experiential knowledge of workers who will ultimately share tasks with these systems. To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic grasping is often plagued by the multimodal problem: when a scene contains multiple valid targets, demonstrations of grasping different objects create conflicting training signals. Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Robowheel, a data engine that converts human hand object interaction (HOI) videos into training-ready supervision for cross morphology robotic learning. From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models.

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving in mixed traffic requires a unified understanding of multimodal interactions and dynamic planning under uncertainty. Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.

Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) relies on comprehensive testing and evaluation. However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Visual traversability estimation is critical for autonomous navigation, but existing VLM-based methods rely on hand-crafted prompts, generalize poorly across embodiments, and output only traversability maps, leaving trajectory generation to slow external planners. We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100\% navigation success and 0.09 s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong in-distribution performance but degrade sharply under novel camera viewpoints and visual perturbations. We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.

Abstract: Task-space control of robotic fingers is a critical enabler of dexterous manipulation, as manipulation objectives are most naturally specified in terms of fingertip motions and applied forces rather than individual joint angles. While task-space planning and control have been extensively studied for larger, arm-scale manipulators, demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in compact, multi-DoF robotic fingers remain scarce. In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides one of the first systematic experimental demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in a linkage-driven robotic finger, thereby establishing a benchmark for future designs aimed at dexterous in-hand manipulation.

Abstract: Robust perception and dynamics modeling are fundamental to real-world robotic policy learning. Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic coverage control algorithm allowing a group of robots to track an optimal-deployment configuration for arbitrary time-varying density functions. Building on singular perturbation theory, the proposed design employs a two-time scale separation approach, with a fast time scale corresponding to communication and a slow time scale corresponding to agent motion. The resulting algorithm is distributed over the 2-hop Delaunay graph and, for small enough values of the perturbation parameter, achieves the same performance as its centralized counterpart. We also introduce three discrete-time versions that rely only on 1-hop communication at the cost of having to use delayed information and formally establish their asymptotic convergence properties. Our technical approach combines computational geometry, singular perturbation theory, generating functions, and linear iterations with delayed updates. Various simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine-learning-based solution approach for solving multi-horizon stochastic programs. The approach embeds a deep learning neural network into a multi-horizon stochastic program to approximate the recourse operational objective function. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a UK power system planning problem with uncertainty at investment and operational timescales. The results show that (1) the surrogate neural network performs well across three different architectures, (2) the proposed approach is up to 34.72 times faster than the direct solution of the monolithic deterministic equivalent counterpart, (3) the surrogate-based solutions yield comparable in-sample stability and improved out-of-sample performance relative to the deterministic equivalent, indicating better generalisation to unseen scenarios. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) we propose a machine-learning-based framework for solving multi-horizon stochastic programs, (2) we introduce a neural network embedding formulation tailored to multi-horizon stochastic programs with continuous first-stage decisions and fixed scenario sets, extending existing surrogate modelling approaches from two-stage to multi-horizon settings, and (3) we provide an extensive computational study on a realistic UK power system planning problem, demonstrating the trade-off between approximation accuracy, computational efficiency, and solution robustness for different neural network architectures and scenario set sizes.

Abstract: This paper employs Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) method to a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for satellite attitude control and detumbling. Magnetic torquers have been used as actuators for the stabilization and attitude control of small satellites. NMPC generates the control input which is continuous and smooth. As a result, it is challenging for the on-board actuators to produce these continuous magnetic moments as a control input. Thus, PWM is applied to discretize the control input reducing the load on the actuators. Simulations are presented for detumbling and attitude control to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

Abstract: The stochastic Polyak step size (SPS) has proven to be a promising choice for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), delivering competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on smooth convex and non-convex optimization problems, including deep neural network training. However, extensions of this approach to non-smooth settings remain in their early stages, often relying on interpolation assumptions or requiring knowledge of the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel SPS variant, Safeguarded SPS (SPS$_{safe}$), for the stochastic subgradient method, and provide rigorous convergence guarantees for non-smooth convex optimization with no need for strong assumptions. We further incorporate momentum into the update rule, yielding equally tight theoretical results. Comprehensive experiments on convex benchmarks and deep neural networks corroborate our theory: the proposed step size accelerates convergence, reduces variance, and consistently outperforms existing adaptive baselines. Finally, in the context of deep neural network training, our method demonstrates robust performance by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.

Abstract: Since the classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller has continued to be the most widely used feedback methods in engineering systems by far, it is crucial to investigate the working mechanism of PID in dealing with nonlinearity, uncertainty and random noises. Recently, Zhao and Guo (2022) has established the global stability of PID control for a class of uncertain nonlinear control systems with relative degree two without random perturbations. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of nonlinear stochastic systems with an arbitrary relative degree $n$, and discuss the stability and design of extended PID controller (a natural extension of PID). We demonstrate that, the closed-loop control systems will be globally stable in mean square with bounded tracking errors provided the extended PID parameters are selected from an $(n+1)$-dimensional unbounded set, even if both the system nonlinear drift and diffusion terms contain a wide range of structural uncertainties. Moreover, the steady-state tracking error is proved to be proportional to the noise intensity at the setpoint, which can also be made arbitrarily small by choosing the controller parameters suitably large.

Abstract: This work presents a comparative study of optimization techniques for parameter identification in equivalent electrical models of lithium-ion batteries. The 2RC model is applied to a set of twelve batteries using four publicly available datasets obtained from well-established research institutions. The methodology is structured in four stages: first, the 2RC model is selected due to its balance between physical interpretability and computational simplicity; second, experimental charge-discharge cycle data are collected; third, various optimization techniques are applied with the aim of minimizing the error between the experimental data and the response estimated by the model; and finally, accuracy is evaluated using the mean squared error, while computational efficiency is assessed through execution time. Traditional, metaheuristic, and bio-inspired optimization methods are considered, including least squares optimization, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and several nature-inspired variants. It is demonstrated that bio-inspired techniques achieve greater accuracy than traditional methods, without a significant increase in computational cost. In particular, particle swarm optimization shows superior performance in terms of precision and robustness against local minima. It is concluded that the integration of advanced optimization strategies significantly enhances the fidelity of equivalent electrical models, which is essential for accurate estimation of internal states such as state of charge, aging, and service life in lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles and aerospace systems.

Abstract: In the framework of data envelopment analysis, we review directional models \citep{Chambers1996, Chambers1998, Briec1997} and show that they are inadequate when inputs and outputs are improved simultaneously under constant returns to scale. Conversely, we introduce a new family of quadratically constrained models with generalized orientation and demonstrate that these models overcome this limitation. Furthermore, we extend the Farrell measure of technical efficiency using these new models. Additionally, we prove that the family of generalized oriented models satisfies some desired monotonicity properties. Finally, we show that the new models, although being quadratically constrained, can be solved through linear programs in a fundamental particular case.

Abstract: With the advancement of industrialization and Industry 4.0, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged as a novel paradigm for information exchange in industrial production environments. To ensure the efficient operation of IIoT, it is imperative to develop communication-efficient methods for transmitting massive production data. This paper designs a communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithm for optimization problems subject to coupled equality constraints. While compressed communication is employed to enhance efficiency, it comes at the cost of introducing compression errors that may impair algorithm performance. To eliminate the influence of compression errors, differential compression techniques along with dynamic scaling factors are incorporated into the algorithm design. Linear convergence and constraint satisfaction of the algorithm are established under different types of compressors. Numerical results further demonstrate its effectiveness across three compression scenarios with specific quantizers.

Abstract: This paper studies sum-of-squares (SOS) representations for structured biquadratic forms. We prove that diagonally dominated symmetric biquadratic tensors are always SOS. For the special case of symmetric biquadratic forms, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for positive semi-definiteness of monic symmetric biquadratic forms, characterize the geometry of the corresponding psd cone, and prove that every such psd form is SOS. We also formulate conjectures regarding SOS representations for symmetric M-biquadratic tensors and symmetric B$_0$-biquadratic tensors, discussing their likelihood and potential proof strategies. Our results advance the understanding of when positive semi-definiteness implies sum-of-squares decompositions for structured biquadratic forms.

Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time reinforcement learning for stochastic singular control with the application to an infinite-horizon irreversible reinsurance problems. The singular control is equivalently characterized as a pair of regions of time and the augmented states, called the singular control law. To encourage the exploration in the learning procedure, we propose a randomization method for the singular control laws, new to the literature, by considering an auxiliary singular control and entropy regularization. The exploratory singular control problem is formulated as a two-stage optimal control problem, where the time-inconsistency issue arises in the outer problem. In the specific model setup with known model coefficients, we provide the full characterization of the time-consistent equilibrium singular controls for the two-stage problem. Taking advantage of the solution structure, we can consider the proper parameterization of the randomized equilibrium policy and the value function when the model is unknown and further devise the actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms. In the numerical experiment, we present the superior convergence of parameter iterations towards the true values based on the randomized equilibrium policy and illustrate how the exploration may advance the learning performance in the context of singular controls.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose an abstract framework to establish the convergence of the iterates of stochastic versions of a broad range of monotone operator splitting methods in Hilbert spaces. This framework allows for the introduction of stochasticity at several levels: approximation of operators, selection of coordinates and operators in block-iterative implementations, and relaxation parameters. The proposed analysis involves a reduced inclusion model with two operators. At each iteration, stochastic approximations to points in the graphs of these two operators are used to form the update. The results are applied to derive the almost sure and $L^2$ convergence of stochastic versions of the proximal point algorithm, as well as of randomized block-iterative projective splitting methods for solving systems of coupled inclusions involving a mix of set-valued, cocoercive, and Lipschitzian monotone operators combined via various monotonicity-preserving operations.

Abstract: Cryogenic detectors are at the forefront of rare-event search experiments, including direct detection of dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and searches for fractionally charged particles. Their unique ability to achieve ultra-low energy thresholds, typically O(eV-100 eV), together with excellent energy resolution and effective background suppression, makes them sensitive to extremely faint signals from rare interactions. These rare particle interactions produce phonons, ionization, or scintillation, depending on the target medium, which are registered by specialized sensors and converted into measurable signals. This review summarizes the underlying detection principles, surveys major experiments and recent results, examines forthcoming initiatives, and outlines the evolving role of cryogenic detectors in advancing the frontiers of rare-event physics.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel Trefftz Continuous Galerkin (TCG) method for 2D Helmholtz problems based on evanescent plane waves (EPWs). We construct a new globally-conforming discrete space, departing from standard discontinuous Trefftz formulations, and investigate its approximation properties, providing wavenumber-explicit best-approximation error estimates. The mesh is defined by intersecting the domain with a Cartesian grid, and the basis functions are continuous in the whole computational domain, compactly supported, and can be expressed as simple linear combinations of EPWs within each element. This ensures they remain local solutions to the Helmholtz equation and allows the system matrix to be assembled in closed form for polygonal domains. The discrete space provides stable approximations with bounded coefficients and spectral accuracy for analytic Helmholtz solutions. The approximation error is proved to decay exponentially both at a fixed frequency, with respect to the discretization parameters, and along suitable sequences of increasing wavenumbers, with the number of degrees of freedom scaling linearly with the frequency. Numerical results confirm these theoretical estimates for the full Galerkin error.

Abstract: Metric graphs are structures obtained by associating edges in a standard graph with segments of the real line and gluing these segments at the vertices of the graph. The resulting structure has a natural metric that allows for the study of differential operators and stochastic processes on the graph. Brownian motions in these domains have been extensively studied theoretically using their generators. However, less work has been done on practical algorithms for simulating these processes. We introduce the first algorithm for simulating Brownian motions on metric graphs through a timestep splitting Euler-Maruyama-based discretization of their corresponding stochastic differential equation. By applying this scheme to Langevin diffusions on metric graphs, we also obtain the first algorithm for sampling on metric graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of timestep splittings required for the algorithm to converge to the underlying stochastic process. We also show that the exit probabilities of the simulated particle converge to the vertex-edge jump probabilities of the underlying stochastic differential equation as the timestep goes to zero. Finally, since this method is highly parallelizable, we provide fast, memory-aware implementations of our algorithm in the form of custom CUDA kernels that are up to ~8000x faster than a GPU implementation using PyTorch on simple star metric graphs. Beyond simple star graphs, we benchmark our algorithm on a real cortical vascular network extracted from a DuMuX tissue-perfusion model for tracer transport. Our algorithm is able to run stable simulations with timesteps significantly larger than the stable limit of the finite volume method used in DuMuX while also achieving speedups of up to ~1500x.

Abstract: This paper studies two potential modifications of XTrace (Epperly et al., SIMAX 45(1):1-23, 2024), a randomized algorithm for estimating the trace of a matrix. The first is a variance reduction step that averages the output of XTrace over right-multiplications of the test vectors by random orthogonal matrices. The second is to form a low-rank approximation to the matrix using the whole Krylov space produced by the test vectors, rather than the output of a single power iteration as is used by XTrace. Experiments on synthetic data show that the first modification offers only slight benefits in practice, while the second can lead to significant improvements depending on the spectrum of the matrix.

Abstract: We establish error estimates for semi-Lagrangian schemes for the initial value problem of one-dimensional conservation laws with a dispersive term, including the Korteweg--de Vries equation. The schemes considered in this paper are based on the semi-Lagrangian technique combined with spatial discretization by higher-order interpolation operators. For the semi-Lagrangian schemes equipped with the spline or Hermite interpolation operators of order $ 2 s - 1 $, we derive an $L^2$-error estimate of $ O (Δt^r + h^{2s} / Δt) $ and an $ H^s $-error estimate of $ O (Δt^r + h^{s} / \sqrt{Δt}) $, where $ h $ and $ Δt $ denote the spatial mesh size and the time step size, respectively, and $ r \in \lparen 0, 1\rbrack $ is a parameter determined by the discretization of the dispersive term. A key step in the analysis is to establish the stability of the interpolation operators. Under suitable assumptions, interpolation operators of order $ 2s - 1 $ are stable with respect to the $ H^s $-norm as well as a weighted $ H^s $-norm. The weighted $H^s$-norm depends on $h$ and $Δt$, and it reduces to the $L^2$-norm in the limit $ h \to 0 $.

Abstract: This work focuses on the development of efficient solvers for the pseudo-stress formulation of the unsteady Stokes problem, discretised by means of a discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids (PolyDG). The introduction of the pseudo-stress variable is motivated by the growing interest in non-Newtonian flow models and coupled interface problems, where the stress field plays a fundamental role in the physical description. The space-time discretisation of the problem is obtained by combining the PolyDG approach in space with the implicit Euler method for time integration. The resulting linear system, characterised by a symmetric, positive, definite matrix, exhibits deteriorating convergence with standard solvers as the time step decreases. To address this issue, we investigate two tailored strategies: deflated Conjugate Gradient, which mitigates the effect of the most problematic eigenmodes, and collective Block-Jacobi, which exploits the block structure of the system matrix. Numerical experiments show that both approaches yield iteration counts effectively independent of $Δt$, ensuring robust performance with respect to the time step. Future work will focus on extending this robustness to the spatial discretisation parameter $h$ by integrating multigrid strategies with the time-robust solvers developed in this study.

Abstract: Vertex-patch smoothers are essential for the robust convergence of geometric multigrid methods in high-order finite element applications, yet their adoption is traditionally hindered by the prohibitive cost of solving local patch problems. This paper presents a high-performance, matrix-free implementation of a p-multigrid local solver that dismantles the trade-off between smoothing effectiveness and computational efficiency. We focus on the practical realization of this iterative approach, leveraging sum-factorization and explicit SIMD vectorization to minimize memory footprint and maximize arithmetic throughput. The performance analysis demonstrates that the solver effectively hides data-fetching latencies and maintains optimal $\mathcal{O}(p^d)$ memory scaling, even when dominated by geometric data on distorted meshes. The result is a robust smoother that rivals the execution speed of simple pointwise smoothers while preserving the convergence benefits of patch-based methods.

Abstract: The micropolar Rayleigh-B{é}nard convection system, which consists of Navier-Stokes equations, the angular momentum equation, and the heat equation, is a strongly nonlinear, coupled, and saddle point structural multiphysics system. A second-order pressure projection finite element method, which is linear, fully decoupled, and second-order accurate in time, is proposed to simulate the system. Only a few decoupled linear elliptic problems with constant coefficients are solved at each time step, simplifying calculations significantly. The stability analysis of the method is established and the optimal error estimates are derived rigorously with the negative norm technique. Extensive numerical simulations, including 2D and 3D accuracy tests, the lid-driven cavity flow, and the passive-scalar mixing experiment, are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

Abstract: We introduce a preconditioner for a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations at high Reynolds number. The preconditioner is based on an augmented Lagrangian approach of the full discretization. Unlike standard grad-div type augmentation, however, we consider augmentation based on divergence-conformity. With this augmentation we introduce two different, well-conditioned, and easy to solve matrices to approximate the trace pressure Schur complement. To introduce a completely algebraic solver, we propose to use multifrontal sparse LU solvers using butterfly compression to solve the trace velocity block. Numerical examples demonstrate that the trace pressure Schur complement is highly robust in mesh spacing and Reynolds number and that the multifrontal inexact LU performs well for a wide range of Reynolds numbers.

Abstract: A numerical scheme of relaxation type is proposed to approximate hyperbolic conservation laws in canal networks. Physical conditions at the junction are given and a novel strategy based on [Briani, Natalini, Ribot, 2025] is introduced to approximate the solution, avoiding the use of approximate Riemann solvers. This general approach is applied to shallow water and blood flow equations, dealing both the subcritical and the supercritical case. The relaxation scheme is complemented with a well-balanced strategy to treat source terms. We investigate properties of the numerical scheme and we present many numerical tests in different settings.

Abstract: We introduce the convex matching distance, a novel metric for comparing functions with values in the real plane. This metric measures the maximal bottleneck distance between the persistence diagrams associated with the convex combinations of the two function components. Similarly to the traditional matching distance, the convex matching distance aggregates the information provided by two real-valued components. However, whereas the matching distance depends on two parameters, the convex matching distance depends on only one, offering improved computational efficiency. We further show that the convex matching distance can be more discriminative than the traditional matching distance in certain cases, although the two metrics are generally not comparable. Moreover, we prove that the convex matching distance is stable and characterize the coefficients of the convex combination at which it is attained. Finally, we demonstrate that this new aggregation framework benefits from the computational advantages provided by the Pareto grid, a collection of curves in the plane whose points lie in the image of the Pareto critical set associated with functions assuming values on the real plane.

Abstract: The infinity symmetric power $L$-functions play a fundamental role in Wan's groundbreaking work on Dwork's conjecture[16]. Building upon this foundation, Haessig[8] established the $p$-adic estimates for these $L$-functions in the case of the one-dimensional Kloosterman family. In this paper, we extend Haessig's results by deriving a uniform lower bound for the $q$-adic Newton polygon of the infinite symmetric power $L$-functions associated with the hyper-Kloosterman family. For the $1$-dimensional Kloosterman family, Haessig[8] showed that there is a $p$-adic cohomology theory for the infinity symmetric power $L$-function. In this paper, we prove there is also a cohomological description of the infinity symmetric power $L$-function for the hyper-Kloosterman family. By applying the Frobenius endomorphism to this cohomology, we derive a uniform lower bound for the corresponding $L$-function.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the various schemes proposed by Chebyshev and Sylvester, with a central focus on Sylvester's innovative iterative refinement procedure. By implementing this procedure computationally, we replicate, verify, and optimize the historical results, providing a self-contained pedagogical resource for this pivotal technique in analytic number theory.

Abstract: We consider mod $p$ Hilbert modular forms for a totally real field $F$, viewed as sections of automorphic line bundles on Hilbert modular varieties in prime characteristic $p$. For a Hecke eigenform of arbitrary weight, we prove the existence of an associated two-dimensional representation of the absolute Galois group of $F$. Furthermore, for any such irreducible Galois representation, we formulate a conjecture predicting the set of weights of eigenforms from which it arises. This generalizes Edixhoven's variant of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture (in the case $F = \mathbb{Q}$), and removes the restriction that $p$ be unramified in $F$ from prior work in this direction. We also establish one direction of a conjectural relation with the algebraic analogue of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture in this context. Finally, we prove results towards our conjecture in the case of partial weight one for real quadratic fields $F$ in which $p$ is ramified.

We thus generalize a result Fischler proved in 2021, corresponding to the principal character mod 1. To this end, we construct linear combinations of these values of $L$-function with a refined version of Siegel's lemma, and we apply to them a linear independence criterion generalizing the one used by Fischler. To check the assumptions of this criterion, we rely on a ``Shidlovskii's lemma''.

Abstract: This paper provides the technical tools needed in ongoing work of the authors to compute p-adic étale Abel-Jacobi maps in order to obtain explicit reciprocity laws for GSp4. In particular, we define and study syntomic polynomial cohomology for filtered Frobenius log-isocrystals over proper and semistable schemes over the ring of integers of a local field, with smooth generic fiber, endowed with horizontal divisors. We introduce syntomic polynomial cohomology with support, we define Kunneth morphisms, trace maps and cup products, Gysin maps with respect to divisors and we study some of their properties. We establish the relation with Hyodo-Kato cohomology of the special fiber and de Rham cohomology of the generic fiber. We also introduce overconvergent variants with and without support by restricting to open smooth formal subschemes. Most of all, in case that the filtered log-isocrystal is associated to a p-adic local system on the generic fiber, we establish comparison morphisms between étale and syntomic cohomology and compatibilities with Hochschild-Serre morphisms and between Gysin morphisms.

Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem of $(1/\sqrt{h_p})\sum_{X< n \leq X+h_p}\big(\tfrac{n}{p}\big)$ for almost all the primes $p$, with $X$ uniformly random in $[g(p)]$, $g(p)$ an arbitrary divergent function growing slower than any power of $p$, provided $(\log h_p)/(\log g(p))\rightarrow 0, \, h_p \rightarrow \infty$ as $p \rightarrow \infty$. This improves the recent results of Basak, Nath and Zaharescu, who established this for $g(p) = (\log p)^A, A>1$. We also use the best currently available tools to expand the original central limit theorem of Davenport and Erdős for all the primes to a shorter interval of starting points.
  In this paper we exploit a Selberg's sieve argument, recently used by Harper, an intersection result due to Evertse and Silverman and some consequences of the Weil bound on general character sums.

Abstract: We explore the impact of "slow-light" radiative transfer - i.e., general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations in which the simulated fluid evolves while light rays are propagating through it - in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of the M87 jet. Because the plasma in the jet-launching region is accelerated to relativistic velocities, and because the jet in M87 is nearly aligned with the line of sight (offset by ~17 degrees), a slow-light treatment is important for accurately modeling the observable structure. While fast-light images exhibit prominent helical or loop-shaped features in the jet - which we associate with narrow bundles of magnetic field lines - these features become stretched and smoothed-out in slow-light images. Our slow-light images instead exhibit a double-edged, cone-like morphology that is more consistent with observations of M87 than corresponding fast-light images. We find that the radius at which the plasma transitions from sub-relativistic to relativistic velocities is imprinted on slow-light images via a transition from loop-dominated at small distances from the black hole to edge-dominated at a larger distance, with the loop-edge transition occurring at larger distances for lower black hole spins. The jet image dynamics also vary with black hole spin, with low-spin models producing jets that exhibit substantial "wobbling", while high-spin models produce jets that are straighter and more stable in time. The spin-dependent jet morphology and variability are revealed by slow-light imaging because slow-light effects become more enhanced as the plasma velocity becomes more relativistic, and because the plasma acceleration is itself a strong function of the spin.

Abstract: We present global 3D GRMHD simulations of black hole (BH) accretion disks designed to investigate how MRI-driven dynamo action regulates jet formation and evolution. Unlike standard SANE/MAD setups that impose a coherent large-scale poloidal loop, our "sub-SANE" initial conditions use multiple same-polarity small-scale magnetic loops. Rapid reconnection erases magnetic memory and enables large-scale dynamo to emerge early from MRI turbulence. We perform two such sub-SANE simulations at different BH spins ($a = 0.5, 0.9375$) and compare them with conventional SANE runs. The sub-SANE disks show regular large-scale dynamo cycles with periods of about ten orbits. Decomposition of the induction equation shows that the turbulent dynamo term is stronger in 3D compared to 2.5D and balances advection in the saturated state, confirming sustained large-scale field generation. These dynamo-generated fields are advected inward with minimal time lag, producing correlated peaks in both poloidal and toroidal field strengths from $r_{\rm max}$ to the horizon. Early in the evolution, these peaks imprint directly onto the jet's electromagnetic energy flux, indicating that the jet mirrors the dynamo wave. Though jets form at early times, the sub-SANE runs eventually undergo jet shutdown. We show that this occurs when the magnetic field at the horizon loses coherence, as quantified by a decline in the signed-to-unsigned flux ratio $\mathcal{C}_{\rm BH}$ below $\approx 0.6$. In contrast, the SANE reference case with similar accretion rate and horizon magnetic flux maintains high magnetic coherence because its initial large-scale field persists, allowing its jet to survive. Our results show that both dynamo-driven field evolution and horizon magnetic-field coherence critically regulate jet longevity, establishing a direct dynamo-jet connection in GRMHD disks.

Abstract: EP240222a is the first intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) tidal disruption event (TDE) captured in real-time with multi-wavelength observations and spectroscopic confirmation. However, its light curves deviate substantially from previous theoretical expectations. Motivated by these unique features, we have developed a novel model that successfully reproduces its peculiar evolution. Our model delineates five stages: (1) Initial Stage of inefficient circularization; (2) Slow-Rising Stage with a faint X-ray precursor disk fed by successive self-crossings; (3) Fast-Rising Stage, where delayed stream-disk interaction at momentum flux matching drives a sharp luminosity rise; (4) Plateau Stage with super-Eddington accretion, outflow, reprocessing, and a clear polar line-of-sight; and (5) Decline Stage of sub-Eddington accretion and ongoing reprocessing. Our fit indicates the disruption of a $M_* \approx 0.4~M_\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star with a penetration factor $β\approx 1.0$. Our model, which incorporates key TDE processes, establishes EP240222a-like light curves as typical IMBH-TDE signatures. The distinctive identifier is a slow rise in X-rays and a corresponding slow rise/quasi-plateau in the UV/optical, followed by a brighter, super-Eddington plateau in both bands, though other forms exist, such as the rapid rise from white dwarf (WD) disruptions over minutes to days.

Abstract: To investigate the impact of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties on type I X-ray burst nucleosynthesis, comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed with temperature-independent and -dependent variations in reaction rates using the REACLIB and STARLIB libraries, respectively. A total of 1,711 $(p, γ)$, $(p, α)$, $(α, p)$, and $(α, γ)$ reactions are varied simultaneously, along with their inverse reactions, via detailed balance. For the first time, it is found that Monte Carlo sampling with larger perturbations to these reaction rates may lead to multi-peaked abundance distributions for some isotopes. These multi-peak structures arise not only from coupled reactions but also, in some cases, from single reactions. Our study also confirmed previously identified key reactions and provides more robust lists. These reactions deserve priority consideration in future study.

Abstract: High-energy astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei, quasars, X-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts are powered by mechanisms that convert gravitational or rotational energy into radiation, jets, and relativistic outflows. Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations.

Abstract: The formation channels of binary neutron stars (BNSs) remain uncertain. The detection of GW190425 by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) suggests a subpopulation of massive BNSs, possibly formed through unstable "case BB" mass transfer with short merger delays. We investigate whether next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) can identify and characterise such subpopulations. Using the latest LVK constraints on the BNS merger rate, we generate mock ET catalogues containing a mixture of light and heavy subpopulations. The redshift distribution of each subpopulation is modeled as the convolution of the cosmic star formation rate with a time-delay distribution: heavy BNSs have fixed short delays, while light BNSs follow power-law delays with indices -0.5,-1,-1.5. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses are then performed on catalogues of 100-5,000 events. With hundreds of detections from ET, we will be able to establish that the total mass distribution is bimodal. A few thousand events are sufficient to disentangle the redshift distributions of the two subpopulations for moderate time-delay indices (-0.5 or -1). For steeper indices (-1.5), the differences are more subtle, requiring larger catalogues, beyond what we could explore given our computational resources. Next-generation detectors should enable the detection of multiple BNS subpopulations and their redshift evolution, providing valuable insight into their formation pathways.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have become an indispensable tool for studying the Universe's ionisation properties, as well as its cosmological parameters. This is achieved by analysing their diffuse dispersion measure (${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$) as a function of redshift. However, this requires an integration along the line-of-sight, which is time-consuming. In this work, we derive an analytical approximation formula for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$ for flat, $Λ$CDM and $w$CDM universes. We show that our approximation works well for the ranges $0.01 \leq z \leq 2$, $0.2 \leq Ω_m \leq 1.0$ and $-3.0 \leq w \leq -0.5$, with relative fractional error to a numerically evaluated ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$ always smaller than $3.5\ \%$, in the worst case scenario, and in most cases smaller than $0.5\ \%$. Moreover, the approximation is more than $15$ ($2$) times faster than the numerical solution of $Λ$CDM ($w$CDM). Therefore, we hope that it could be a useful tool for the FRB community.

Abstract: M31 UCXB-1 is one of the brightest X-ray point sources in the bulge of M31, with a peak X-ray luminosity $ L_{\mathrm{0.5-10 \: keV}} = 2.9^{+0.2}_{-0.2} \times 10^{38} \: \mathrm{erg} \: \mathrm{s}^{-1} $. Both XMM-Newton and Chandra observations have detected an eclipsing signal with a period of about 465 seconds from this source, and we note that the periodic signal is detected exclusively during the source's high-luminosity states. This signal probably originates from its orbital motion, therefore it is an ultra-compact X-ray binary (UCXB) candidate with the highest X-ray luminosity. Our theoretical analyses show that M31 UCXB-1 is in good agreement with the luminosity-orbital period relation ($ L_{\mathrm{2-10 \: keV}}-P_{\mathrm{orb}} $) of the black hole/neutron star--white dwarf (BH/NS--WD) UCXB system. Moreover, our spectral analyses indicate that the primary in M31 UCXB-1 is more likely to be a BH rather than an NS. The results show that M31 UCXB-1 is a BH--WD system, with the shortest orbital period, the possibly strongest gravitational wave emission, and the most massive white dwarf among the known UCXBs.

Abstract: It has been suggested that there are $\sim 10^5$ black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries in our Galaxy. However, despite the effort of intensive radio search for decades, none of these binaries has been found to date. These binaries are regarded as a holy grail of astronomy because they can greatly improve our understanding about relativistic systems of compact objects and fundamental physics. In this article, we propose the existence of exotic BH-NS binaries which can open a new way in searching the missing BH-NS binaries in our Galaxy. By considering the possible dark matter density spikes formed around the primordial black holes in the BH-NS binaries, we show that extremely high temperature ($\sim 10^6$ K) could be maintained on the surface of the neutron stars due to effective dark matter capture. This interesting feature can also help reveal the nature of dark matter and possibly further improve the upper limit of dark matter scattering cross section well below $10^{-47}$ cm$^2$.

Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has recently reported five Galactic microquasars as Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) $γ$-ray emitters (> 100 TeV). Among these sources, the microquasar V4641 Sgr exhibits $γ$-ray emission up to $\sim$0.8 PeV, requiring the acceleration of particles to multi-PeV energies, as well as the hardest UHE spectrum. The mechanisms behind particle acceleration to such energies are not well understood. Furthermore, the limited multi-wavelength (MWL) information on this source appears contradictory, further complicating interpretation and suggesting that V4641 Sgr may represent a particularly unusual case. In this work, we present a detailed physical model of V4641 Sgr that combines first-principles simulations of stochastic (turbulent) particle acceleration with MWL emission modeling. We adopt a leptonic scenario in which electrons are accelerated via the second-order Fermi process driven by relativistic strong turbulence ($δB/B \sim 1$). The particle energization is simulated using a dedicated Monte Carlo framework STRIPE that incorporates the effects of intermittent energy gains and radiative losses. The resulting accelerated electrons produce UHE $γ$-rays through inverse Compton scattering on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the interstellar radiation fields (ISRF). Our model is capable of reproducing key observational characteristics of the system, including particle acceleration to energies of tens of PeV, as well as the TeV-PeV $γ$-ray spectrum and the hard spectral index measured by LHAASO. Nonetheless, several aspects remain unresolved, highlighting the need for deeper observational coverage and further theoretical refinement.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are energetic radio bursts that typically last for milliseconds. They are mostly of extragalactic origin, but the progenitors, trigger mechanisms and radiation processes are still largely unknown. Here we present a comprehensive analysis on 415 non-repeating FRBs detected by CHIME, applying manual filtering to ensure sample completeness. It is found that the distribution of fluence can be approximated by a three-segment power-law function, with the power-law indices being $-3.76 \pm 1.61$, $0.20 \pm 0.68$ and $2.06 \pm 0.90$ in the low, middle, and high fluence segments, respectively. Both the total dispersion measure (\text{DM}) and the extragalactic \text{DM} follow a smoothly broken power-law distribution, with characteristic break DM values of $\sim 703$ pc $\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\sim 639$ pc $\rm cm^{-3}$, respectively. The redshifts are estimated from the extragalactic \text{DM} by using the Macquart relation, which are found to peak at $ z \sim 0.6$. The isotropic energy release ($E_{\text{iso}}$) is also derived for each burst. Two-Gaussian components are revealed in the distribution of $E_{\text{iso}}$, with the major population narrowly clustered at $\sim 2.3 \times 10^{40} {\rm erg}$. The minor population have a characteristic energy of $\sim 1.6 \times 10^{39}$ erg and span approximately one order of magnitude. The distribution hints a near-uniform energy release mechanism for the dominant population as expected from some catastrophic channels, whereas the lower-energy component (potentially including repeat-capable sources) may reflect a broader diversity in FRB origins, emission mechanisms and evolutionary stages.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The cosmological distribution and formation rate of compact astrophysical objects such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are typically assumed to be proportional to a linear combination of cosmological star formation rate and stellar mass. In the literature, a template for star formation rate, which is just a function of redshift, is typically used. In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results. This consideration is also applicable to other transients, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and merging binary black hole events. We show that our approach may open up the possibility to infer the host galaxy stellar mass of merging binary black holes with a detection of few thousand gravitational wave events.

Abstract: Blazars are promising targets for neutrino astronomy, as highlighted by IceCube's identification of TXS 0506+056 as a cosmic neutrino source candidate. High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) stand out due to their characteristic electromagnetic high-energy emission properties, which makes them as well promising candidates for the production of high-energy neutrinos. Such neutrinos could be detected by KM3NeT/ARCA, a next-generation deep-sea Cherenkov detector under construction in the Mediterranean Sea. This contribution presents the results of a binned likelihood stacking analysis investigating high-energy neutrino emissions from a subset of HBLs. A total of 232 sources have been selected from the 3HSP catalogue and targeted in the analysis of KM3NeT/ARCA data taken with several detector configurations, specifically in the period in which from 6 to 21 detection units were deployed. The analysis is based on neutrino emission models of blazars developed using the LeHa-Paris numerical code, which simulates the spectral energy distribution of jetted active galactic nuclei.

Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio pulses originating from cosmological distances, as indicated by their large dispersion measures. While numerous FRBs have now been localised to their host galaxies, a distinct class of compact electromagnetic counterpart, a Persistent Radio Source (PRS), has also been identified in some cases. Currently, only three, and possible a fourth repeating FRBs (FRB20121102A, FRB20190417A, FRB20190520B, and FRB20240114A) have confirmed associations with a PRS. Insight into progenitors, local environments, and the evolution of FRBs can be clarified by characterising these PRSs. In this work, we present 2 detected candidate PRSs using MeerKAT radio telescope data and one non-detection (as part of a larger study involving 25 FRB positions). Both FRB20221106 and FRB20181112 were found to have a host galaxy, and whether the detected radio continuum emission comes from the host galaxy or PRS is still an open question. High-resolution observations from a telescope such as e-MERLIN are required to resolve this question. If a compact PRS is detected, this telescope will provide the size, and investigate the flux variability and spectral shape of this compact PRS. Lastly, in the case of FRB220190102, which was observed over two epochs, no radio continuum was detected. However, a flux upper limit is provided for both epochs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Very high-energy (VHE) detected flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are relatively few despite being the most persistent bright MeV-GeV sources. Focusing on VHE emission, we investigated the spectral and temporal properties of VHE-detected FSRQs using 14-year Fermi-LAT data. All are highly variable (flux-amplitude$>$100) with VHE detection associated with brighter flux states and relatively harder spectra. Above a flux limit, flux anti-correlates with spectral index, exhibiting a bluer-when-brighter trend. The low-flux state spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all resembles a power-law, while high-flux and VHE-associated states resemble a log-parabola, accompanied by an almost nil (PKS0736+017, PKS1510-089) to marginal (4C+21.35, 3C279) to significant (B21420+32, TON0599, PKS1441+25, S30218+35, PKS0346-27, OP313) MeV-GeV peak-upshift -- more prominent in high-redshift sources. For no/marginal peak-upshift, the VHE emission is consistent with external Comptonization of infrared photons (EC-IR) driven primarily by a power-law continuation of the particle spectrum to higher energies. For those with a significant MeV-GeV peak-upshift, PKS0346-27 and OP313 shows peak-upshift in the synchrotron spectrum, and thus VHE is EC-IR origin, while for others without synchrotron-peak upshift, we attribute the VHE to an HBL-like component with a Compton-Dominance (CD) like FSRQs, with VHE driven primarily by particle spectrum continuation. In some, even high-state SEDs seem to require an HBL-like component. Thus, VHE activities in FSRQs mainly result from particle spectrum continuation, aided by spectral transition or a new HBL-like component with FSRQ-like CD. Such spectral changes naturally brighten the GeV-VHE flux, overcoming extragalactic background light absorption without requiring extraordinary brightening under the traditional EC-IR scenario than normally exhibited.

Abstract: The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is the accumulated light emitted throughout the history of the universe, spanning the UV, optical, and IR spectral ranges. Stars and dust in galaxies are expected to be the main source of the EBL. However, recent direct measurements performed beyond Pluto's orbit (less affected by foregrounds than those performed from the Earth) hint at an EBL level in the optical band larger than the one expected from the integrated contribution of known galaxy populations. One approach that could solve this controversy uses Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. These photons can interact with the EBL producing electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint on the observed VHE spectrum. This technique, however, requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can compromise the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, we used Monte Carlo simulations and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes to study the impact that the assumptions adopted in the literature have on the estimate of the EBL density, and how using more generic ones would modify the results. Our results show how the EBL density constraints obtained highly depend on the intrinsic spectral shape assumed for the source. We have studied two different methods to reduce the assumptions on the intrinsic spectral shape to get more robust results. This will be especially important for upcoming with new VHE facilities, where systematic uncertainties are expected to play a more significant role compared to statistical ones.

Abstract: Human-factor analysis typically employs correlation analysis and significance testing to identify relationships between variables. However, these descriptive ('what-is') methods, while effective for identifying associations, are often insufficient for answering causal ('what-if') questions. Their application in such contexts often overlooks confounding and colliding variables, potentially leading to bias and suboptimal or incorrect decisions.
  We advocate for explicitly distinguishing descriptive from interventional questions in human-factor analysis, and applying causal inference frameworks specifically to these problems to prevent methodological mismatches. This approach disentangles complex variable relationships and enables counterfactual reasoning. Using post-occupancy evaluation (POE) data from the Center for the Built Environment's (CBE) Occupant Survey as a demonstration case, we show how causal discovery reveals intervention hierarchies and directional relationships that traditional associational analysis misses. The systematic distinction between causally associated and independent variables, combined with intervention prioritization capabilities, offers broad applicability to complex human-centric systems, for example, in building science or ergonomics, where understanding intervention effects is critical for optimization and decision-making.

Our analysis shows that professional players use a wider variety of shots and favor backcourt play to maintain control, while intermediate players concentrate more on mid-court shots, generate more errors, and exercise less positional control. These results quantify strategic differences in squash, offer a simple method to compare player and team skill, and provide actionable insights for sports analytics and coaching.

Abstract: In our previous article, we estimated excess mortality during in Aotearoa New Zealand for 2020 to 2023. Since our work was published, updated population estimates have been released by Statistics NZ. In this short letter, we provide the results of applying our original model to the new population data. Our updated excess mortality estimate of 2.0% (95% CI [0.5%, 3.3%]) is 1.3 percentage points higher than our original estimate because the new population estimates for the period 2020 to 2023 are smaller, but the main conclusions of our original article still apply.

Abstract: Beaconless geocast protocols are routing protocols used to send messages in mobile ad-hoc wireless networks, in which the only information available to each node is its own location. Messages get routed in a distributed manner: each node uses local decision rules based on the message source and destination, and its own location. In this paper we analyze six different beaconless geocast protocols, focusing on two relevant 1D scenarios. The selection of protocols reflects the most relevant types of protocols proposed in the literature, including those evaluated in previous computer simulations. We present a formal and structured analysis of the maximum number of messages that a node can receive, for each protocol, in each of the two scenarios. This is a measure of the network load incurred by each protocol. Our analysis, that for some of the protocols requires an involved probabilistic analysis, confirms behaviors that had been observed only through simulations before.

Abstract: We introduce the complexity class Quantified Reals ($\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$). Let FOTR be the set of true sentences in the first-order theory of the reals. A language $L$ is in $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$, if there is a polynomial time reduction from $L$ to FOTR. This seems the first time this complexity class is studied. We show that $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$ can also be defined using real Turing machines. It is known that deciding FOTR requires at least exponential time unconditionally [Berman, 1980].
  We focus on devil's games with two defining properties: (1) Players (human and devil) alternate turns and (2) each turn has a continuum of options.
  First, we show that FOTRINV is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. FOTRINV has only inversion and addition constraints and all variables are in a compact interval. FOTRINV is a stepping stone for further reductions.
  Second, we show that the Packing Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. In the Packing Game we are given a container and two sets of pieces. One set of pieces for the human and one set for the devil. The human and the devil alternate by placing a piece into the container. Both rotations and translations are allowed. The first player that cannot place a piece loses.
  Third, we show that the Planar Extension Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given a partially drawn plane graph and the human and the devil alternate by placing vertices and the corresponding edges in a straight-line manner. The vertices and edges to be placed are prescribed before hand. The first player that cannot place a vertex loses.
  Finally, we show that the Order Type Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given an order-type together with a linear order. The human and the devil alternate in placing a point in the Euclidean plane following the linear order. The first player that cannot place a point correctly loses.
