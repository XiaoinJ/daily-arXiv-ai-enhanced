The application of classical optimal control methods, the dynamic programming method and the Pontryagin maximum principle for such a model encounters difficulties associated with the possible non-smoothness of the Bellman function, and in the Pontryagin method the problem is to solve a boundary value problem with discontinuous control. Therefore, in the paper, optimal control is sought in the class of the so-called parametric strategies, which reduces the original problem to a finite-dimensional optimization problem with respect to unknown parameters."}

However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the \"flatness\" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models."}

In this work, we present an additive Vanka smoother that requires a much lower shift than point-wise smoothers, and thereby enhances the scalability.

This linear combination can be understood through elementary permutations of the arguments of the hyperbolic function. We use generating functions and hyperbolic identities to relate the representations. The permutation representation is radically different to previously known structures in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and naturally supersedes the previous power series representation for future use, in our opinion.

Unlike conventional approaches that may treat data sources equally, our method learns trust weights for each modality through a Dirichlet prior, automatically calibrating the relative information content of disparate observations. Applied to the Beirut explosion, the framework yields an estimate of 0.34--0.48 kt TNT equivalent, representing 12 to 17 percent detonation efficiency relative to the 2.75 kt theoretical maximum from the blast's stored ammonium nitrate. The fractional posterior approach demonstrates superior uncertainty quantification compared to single-modality estimates while providing robustness against systematic biases.

For labeled topologies with $n$ leaves, we enumerate the total number of labeled histories with at-most-$r$-furcation.

Although classical methodologies focus on minimizing the expectation of a random loss, in many applications, risk-averse decision-makers may be interested in minimizing a specific quantile as a more prudent alternative. In this paper, we propose a new risk-averse contextual stochastic optimization problem with a quantile objective for general two-stage problems. Given historical data on the model's random parameters and contextual information, we model the conditional quantile by replacing the conditional expectation in its variational characterization with a generic estimator. Under two sets of mild regularity conditions, we derive the asymptotic almost-sure convergence and convergence in probability of the optimal solution and the optimal value of the associated optimization problem to their true counterparts. Optimization problems with a quantile objective is usually non-convex, which are generally regarded as challenging to solve. To address the computational difficulties, we propose a new stochastic inexact constraint generation method with convergence guarantee. Finally, through numerical experiments on a single-server appointment scheduling problem, we study the computational performance of our proposed solution method as well as operational performance of our proposed methodology. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating useful contextual information and decision-maker's risk attitude into the optimization model."}

We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit.

We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz.

While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation."}

However, when one wishes to be precise and quantify the amount of turbulence in a supernova simulation, one immediately encounters the problem that turbulence is difficult to define and measure. Using the 3D magnetohydrodynamic code ELEPHANT, we study how different definitions of turbulence change one's conclusions about the amount of turbulence in a supernova and the extent to which it helps the explosion. We find that, while all the definitions of turbulence we use lead to a qualitatively similar growth pattern over time of the turbulent kinetic energy in the gain region, the total amount of turbulent kinetic energy, and especially the ratios of turbulent to total kinetic energy, distinguish them. Some of the definitions appear to indicate turbulence is a necessary contributor to the explosion, and others indicate it is not. The different definitions also produce turbulence maps with different correlations with maps of the enstrophy, a quantity widely regarded as also indicating the presence of turbulence. We also compute the turbulent adiabatic index and observe that in regions of low enstrophy, this quantity is sensitive to the definition used. As a consequence, the effective adiabatic index depends upon the method used to measure the turbulence and thus alter one's conclusions regarding the impact of turbulence within the supernova."}

We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems. This work offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces."}

This paper presents a data-driven decision support tool that models epidemiological dynamics and optimises vaccination strategies to control disease spread whilst minimising economic losses. The proposed economic-epidemiological framework comprises three phases: modelling, optimising, and analysing. First, a stochastic compartmental model captures epidemic dynamics. Second, an optimal control problem is formulated to derive vaccination strategies that minimise pandemic-related expenditure. Given the analytical intractability of epidemiological models, neural networks are employed to calibrate parameters and solve the high-dimensional control problem. The framework is demonstrated using COVID-19 data from Victoria, Australia, empirically deriving optimal vaccination strategies that simultaneously minimise disease incidence and governmental expenditure. By employing this three-phase framework, policymakers can adjust input values to reflect evolving transmission dynamics and continuously update strategies, thereby minimising aggregate costs, aiding future pandemic preparedness."}

To address this challenge, we propose Edge-ANN, an innovative ANN framework specifically engineered for storage efficiency. The core innovation of Edge-ANN lies in its departure from traditional tree-based methods that store high-dimensional hyperplanes. Instead, it leverages pairs of existing data items, termed \"anchors,\" to implicitly define spatial partitions. To ensure these partitions are both balanced and effective, we have developed a novel Binary Anchor Optimization algorithm.This architectural shift eliminates the dimension-dependence of the space complexity. Rigorous experiments on three multi-source datasets, MillionAID, High-resolution Urban Complex Dataset, and GlobalUrbanNet Dataset, demonstrate that under simulated edge environments with dual storage constraints, Edge-ANN achieves a 30-40% reduction in secondary storage compared to the baseline, at the cost of a minor 3-5% drop in retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, its overall retrieval performance surpasses that of other mainstream methods in these constrained scenarios. Collectively, these results establish Edge-ANN as a state-of-the-art solution for enabling large-scale, high-performance, real-time remote sensing feature retrieval on edge devices with exceptionally constrained storage. The codes of Edge-ANN are available at https://github.com/huaijiao666/Edge-ANN."}

Assuming that mosquitoes can also feed on other non-competent hosts (i.e. hosts that cannot infect others), we first review some results from the literature by showing that protective behaviour may either decrease or increase the value of the reproduction number of the epidemic depending on multiple elements. Then, assuming that changes in opinion occur much faster than the spread of the disease, we exploit an approach based on the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory to reduce the two-group model to a model for a homogeneous host population. Then, we use the resulting model to investigate the effect of information-induced behavioural changes on the transient dynamics of the epidemic, discussing the case when protective measures induced an outbreak with a low attack rate. We illustrate how behavioural changes might either help in containing an epidemic outbreak or make the epidemic last longer, even triggering recurrent damped epidemic waves. We conclude with numerical simulations to illustrate our analytical results."}

For one-dimensional critical systems, however, excited states can be directly accessed from the eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian that is constructed from the ground state obtained by variational matrix product state (MPS) optimization. Despite its numerical success, the theoretical mechanism underlying this method has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes."}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Accurate and precise measurements of neutron star radii provide invaluable information about the cold, dense matter in neutron star cores. Analyses of synthetic X-ray pulse waveform data similar to the data obtained from non-accreting neutron stars using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have indicated that mass and radius estimates made using such data are robust against some systematic errors that may be made when modeling these data, such as errors in the assumed pattern of the thermal X-ray emission from the surface of these stars. A potentially important but so far unexplored source of systematic error is misparameterization of unmodulated background components, which can bias the inferred radius, particularly when data from different telescopes are used in the analysis. In this study, we investigate the effects of the background model on radius estimates by jointly analyzing synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton data, using the $\\sim 2.1~M_\\odot$ pulsar PSR~J0740$+$6620 as a prototypical example. Our analysis shows that even if the background assumed in the model underestimates the actual background by a factor of more than five, the resulting shift of the radius posterior from the true value of the radius corresponds to only $\\sim1σ$. In all the cases we examined, the Bayesian evidence for the correct background model is greater than for the incorrect background model. These results add to the evidence that analyses of NICER-like data provide accurate measurements of neutron star radii when the statistical sampling is thorough and the model fits the data well."}

The most likely particle accelerator is pulsar J1740+1000 which if offset by 13' north of the UHE source but appears to be connected to it by an extended feature seen in X-rays. For a plausible pulsar distance of 1.2 kpc, 1LHAASO J1740+0948u must be located about 5 pc away which requires rapid transport of electrons along the feature to avoid radiative losses.

It reconstructs deformable human geometry from 2D images and subsequently refines and optimizes it using associated LiDAR point data. Using MobileOcc, we establish benchmarks for two tasks, i) Occupancy prediction and ii) Pedestrian velocity prediction, using different methods including monocular, stereo, and panoptic occupancy, with metrics and baseline implementations for reproducible comparison.

Objectives: We aimed to quantify the effects of extreme maximum temperatures and heatwaves on daily mortality in Catalonia (2012--2022), and to assess the modifying and confounding roles of air pollutants and socioeconomic factors. Methods: We conducted a time--series ecological study across 379 basic health areas (ABS) during summer months. Mortality data from the Spanish National Statistics Institute were linked with meteorological and air pollution data. A hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal model, incorporating structured and unstructured random effects, was used to account for spatial and temporal dependencies, as well as observed socioeconomic confounders. Results: In total, 730,634 deaths occurred, with 216,989 in summer. Extreme heat alone was not independently associated with mortality, as its effect was fully confounded by high ozone levels and partly by socioeconomic indicators. Ozone concentrations ($\\ge 120 μg/m^3$) significantly increased mortality risk, especially among individuals aged $\\ge 85$ years. Greater income inequality and higher proportions of older residents also amplified vulnerability. Conclusion: Mortality risks from extreme heat in Catalonia were strongly influenced by ozone levels and social determinants. Adaptation strategies should address both compound environmental exposures together with socioeconomic vulnerability to better protect older and disadvantaged populations."}

We consider systems driven by both continuous fluctuations and discrete regime changes, allowing for model misspecification in both the diffusion and switching components. Within a unified framework, we study four classical cost formulations finite horizon, infinite-horizon discounted and ergodic costs, and the exit time cost, and establish continuity of value functions and robustness of optimal controls. Specifically, we show that as a sequence of approximating regime switching models converges to the true model, the associated value functions and optimal policies converge as well, ensuring vanishing performance loss. The analysis relies on the regularity of the solution to the associated weakly coupled HJB systems, and their stochastic representation. The results extend the robustness framework developed for diffusion processes to a significantly broader class of hybrid systems with interacting continuous and discrete dynamics."}

It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\\pm 15\\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be. In particular, the discovery of a population of sub-solar PBHs would set stringent constraints on the $s$-wave annihilation cross-section of these particles, a point so far missed in the literature."}

Recent work indicates that the use of robot-to-camera transformation information ({\\ie}, camera extrinsics) benefits the learning process and produces better results. However, camera extrinsics are oftentimes unavailable and estimation methods usually suffer from local minima and poor generalizations. In this paper, we present CalibAll, a simple yet effective method that \\textbf{requires only a single mark} and performs training-free, stable, and accurate camera extrinsic estimation across diverse robots and datasets through a coarse-to-fine calibration pipeline. In particular, we annotate a single mark on an end-effector (EEF), and leverage the correspondence ability emerged from vision foundation models (VFM) to automatically localize the corresponding mark across robots in diverse datasets. Using this mark, together with point tracking and the 3D EEF trajectory, we obtain a coarse camera extrinsic via temporal Perspective-n-Point (PnP). This estimate is further refined through a rendering-based optimization that aligns rendered and ground-true masks, yielding accurate and stable camera extrinsic. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, showing strong robustness and general effectiveness across three robot platforms. It also produces useful auxiliary annotations such as depth maps, link-wise masks, and end-effector 2D trajectories, which can further support downstream tasks."}

We present a new mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation, and develop an efficient linear programming (LP) based branch-and-cut (B&C) algorithm where submodular and outer-approximation inequalities are used to replace the nonlinear constraints and are separated at the nodes of the search tree. One key advantage of the proposed B&C algorithm is that the number of variables in the underlying formulation grows only linearly with the number of customers and facility locations and is one-order of magnitude smaller than that in the underlying formulation of a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in the literature. Moreover, we propose two new families of strong valid inequalities, called enhanced outer-approximation and lifted subadditive inequalities, to strengthen the LP relaxation and speed up the convergence of the proposed B&C algorithm. In extensive computational experiments on a testbed of 240 benchmark MPCLP instances, we show that, thanks to the small problem size and the strong LP relaxation of the underlying formulation, the proposed B&C algorithm significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in terms of running time, number of nodes in the search tree, and number of solved instances.

It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior.

The final detector configurations at the proposed FCC-ee are yet to be determined and this study aims to contribute to this discussion by benchmarking the particle identification (PID) performance of the proposed CLD and IDEA detectors using fully simulated events. At present, neither detector proposal includes dedicated PID systems, relying instead on information from the tracking subsystems. We estimate the expected level of contamination due to misidentified charged hadrons for $b$-flavour tagging, rare $b\\to s$ transitions, and $s$-jet tagging. The PID information provided by silicon trackers, namely time-of-flight and energy-deposit measurements, leads to significant background suppression with high signal efficiency for the low-momentum hadrons considered for same-side $b$-flavour tagging. In order to improve the contamination in rare decays where momenta are in the medium range, only good timing resolution of 30ps and below can yield an improvement of one order of magnitude below the level achieved by kinematic criteria alone. Light-quark jet-flavour tagging requires identification of particles with very large momentum, which is not possible using only time-of-flight or energy-deposit information in silicon. Access to the number of clusters in a drift-chamber setup, as proposed for the IDEA detector however, results in strong background suppression in every case. This suppression can be further improved in some scenarios by time-of-flight resolution of 30-50ps or better. The PID quality generally exhibits only a small dependence on the cluster-counting efficiency. Whether dedicated PID detectors could further enhance flavour-physics sensitivity should be the subject of future study."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has identified several individual neutrino emitters associated with supermassive black hole accretion phenomena, including blazars, tidal disruption events, and, unexpectedly, Seyfert galaxies. A key open question is which types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are most likely to be neutrino emitters. Here we show that high-confidence extragalactic neutrino emitters tend not only to have higher hard X-ray fluxes but also to be more variable in mid-infrared (MIR) than other AGNs in the \\textit{Swift} BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. MIR variations effectively trace long-term fluctuations in AGN accretion disks and/or jets. In addition to the role of X-ray flux emphasized in previous studies, we speculate that long-term central engine fluctuations may also be critical for neutrino production. This hypothesis may inform IceCube neutrino-electromagnetic counterpart association studies and provide new insights into cosmic ray acceleration sites. First, the observed neutrinos are unlikely to originate from AGN host galaxies or from interactions between large-scale (dozens of parsecs) winds/outflows and the surrounding interstellar medium. Second, if neutrinos are produced in the X-ray corona, the corona should exhibit strong magnetic turbulence dissipation or magnetic reconnection whose rate changes substantially on timescales of years. Third, the relativistic jets of blazar neutrino emitters may be intrinsically unstable over years. Finally, if neutrinos are related to interactions between small-scale winds/outflows and torus clouds, such winds/outflows must be highly episodic."}

Model-based and learning-based methods often fail in highly dynamic scenarios because traditional methods assume a static environment and cannot adapt to real-time changes, while learning-based methods rely on single-frame observations for motion constraint estimation, limiting their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework that leverages multi-frame point constraints, including current and future frames predicted by a dedicated module, to enable proactive end-to-end navigation. By incorporating a prediction module that forecasts the future path of moving obstacles based on multi-frame observations, our method allows the robot to proactively anticipate and avoid potential dangers.

Although GLADMM achieves the same total convergence rate of $O(\\frac{1}{N})$ as in existing results, the partial convergence rate is improved from $O(\\frac{1}{N^{3/2}})$ to $O(\\frac{1}{N^2})$. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we conduct numerical experiments on various problem instances, including the $\\ell_1$ regularized logistic regression, quadratic programming, and compressive sensing. The experimental results indicate that our algorithms outperform existing methods in terms of efficiency. This also demonstrates the potential of the stochastic algorithmic versions of these algorithms in application areas such as statistics, machine learning, and data mining. Finally, it is worth noting that this paper aims to introduce how Güler's acceleration technique can be applied to gradient-based algorithms and to provide a unified and concise framework for their construction."}

We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains. We also discuss how the correlated phase of the isolated chain is characterized by boundary zeros in its single-particle Green's function, and briefly comment on their localization properties in relation to the boundary spins."}

However, most existing approaches treat observation and action generation in a monolithic and goal-agnostic manner, often leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors. To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

In this study, we investigate the multiwavelength variability of the blazar TON 599, a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ), with a particular emphasis on its emission line behavior. We focus on the Mg II $λ$2798 Å emission line, a key tracer of the ionized gas in the broad-line region (BLR), and its role in jet-induced variability. In addition to optical emission lines, we analyze gamma-rays (0.1-300 GeV), X-rays (0.2-10 keV), optical continuum ($λ$3000 Å), optical polarization, and millimeter-wavelength light curves. Three cross-correlation methods are employed to investigate temporal relationships between the emission line and continuum across various wavelengths. Using the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, our analysis confirms that synchrotron emission dominates the continuum during active states, highlighting the jet's primary role in the observed variability. The Mg II emission line exhibits quasi-simultaneous variability with the optical continuum, suggesting photoionization driven by the jet's non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the minimal time lag between gamma-ray and optical/near-ultraviolet emissions supports a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the most variable component of the gamma-ray emission. These findings highlight the importance of emission line variability and multiwavelength observations in constraining the interaction between jets and the BLR in blazars. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of AGN emission mechanisms and the complex interplay between jets and their surrounding environments."}

While widely used in geophysical flows, its application to plasma kinetics remains limited. To exploit its potential advantages in conservation and scalability, this work applies the conservative cascade semi Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme to the Vlasov equation and related plasma models. A consistency analysis shows that the scheme attains second order spatial accuracy, with the dominant error arising from the geometric approximation of the backtracked region. Moreover, two improvements are introduced: a freestream preserving correction that ensures exact volume conservation, and a maximum principle limiter that suppresses spurious oscillations while maintaining positivity and mass conservation. Numerical tests, including linear advection, guiding center, and relativistic Vlasov Maxwell models, confirm the high accuracy, robustness, and long term stability of the improved CCSL method. Compared with the conservative semi Lagrangian (CSL) and the backward semi Lagrangian (BSL) schemes, it better preserves physical invariants under divergence free conditions, providing a robust and efficient framework for high-fidelity plasma kinetic simulations with good parallel scalability."}

Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes. Then, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into the navigation context, guiding the policy toward consistent actions.

We demonstrate by analyzing time-ordered four-point correlation functions that the threshold behavior of nonlinear response functions encodes the fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons that can combine to any composite topological charge. This feature in particular provides a powerful probe for unambiguously distinguishing non-Abelian anyons, which can form multiple composite charges with distinct nontrivial braid statistics.

In this work, we investigate magnetized particle motion and relativistic accretion processes around a decoupled hairy black hole via extended geometric deformation. The developed geometry involves two hairy parameters that preserve the horizon structure with the additional feature of the fulfillment of weak energy conditions outside the event horizon. We provide the foundation with necessary formalism for magnetized particle motion around a decoupled black hole. The effective potential and innermost stable circular orbits are then derived, which demonstrate a significant reduction of the radius of the latter quantity under the hairy parameters for the magnetized particle.

Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of more significant extinction and the exact evolutionary status of the supposed helium star is uncertain, by comparing J1928$+$1815 with other pulsar binaries, we propose a natural alternative solution: that J1928$+$1815 is a heavyweight black widow system with a massive ablated white dwarf. Due to the pulsar's relatively high spin-down power and short orbital separation, the irradiation heating timescale is uniquely shorter than the cooling timescale for the WD companion. As a result, the WD effectively boils, with its outer layers expanding, overfilling the Roche lobe and producing low-density binary-scale haze opaque in the radio band. If this interpretation is correct, J1928$+$1815 would represent a new category distinct from canonical lightweight black widow systems. Radio eclipses can occur in pulsar binaries across a wider range of WD companion masses than previously thought. Therefore, they do not serve as a definitive indicator of a helium star without its direct detection. We contend that a spectroscopic identification remains the smoking gun for its existence. Given the crowding in this field, an \\textit{HST} imaging in the near-infrared band would provide even better constraints."}

Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness."}

This paper presents a data-driven decision support tool that models epidemiological dynamics and optimises vaccination strategies to control disease spread whilst minimising economic losses. The proposed economic-epidemiological framework comprises three phases: modelling, optimising, and analysing. First, a stochastic compartmental model captures epidemic dynamics. Second, an optimal control problem is formulated to derive vaccination strategies that minimise pandemic-related expenditure. Given the analytical intractability of epidemiological models, neural networks are employed to calibrate parameters and solve the high-dimensional control problem. The framework is demonstrated using COVID-19 data from Victoria, Australia, empirically deriving optimal vaccination strategies that simultaneously minimise disease incidence and governmental expenditure. By employing this three-phase framework, policymakers can adjust input values to reflect evolving transmission dynamics and continuously update strategies, thereby minimising aggregate costs, aiding future pandemic preparedness."}

For the first time, we extend coherence and covariance studies into the hard X-ray band up to 150 keV. We detect a clear drop in coherence above 30 keV on both short- and long-timescales relative to the 2-10 keV reference band. To investigate the origin of the coherent variability, we simultaneously fit the short- and long-timescale covariances and the time-averaged spectra with a Comptonization model. Surprisingly, the electron temperature associated with long-timescale variability is significantly higher than that on short timescales. Moreover, the temperature on long timescales remains relatively constant throughout the hard state, whereas the short-timescale temperature evolves with X-ray luminosity. We attribute the drop in coherence to multiple sources of seed photons, i.e., the blackbody and synchrotron photons. The independence between these two photon fields leads to the drop in coherence. To explain the lower electron temperature on short timescales, we propose a two-Comptonization framework in which short-timescale variability arises from a vertically extended central region, while long-timescale variability originates at larger radii. The elevated geometry of the inner region leads to illumination primarily by cooler outer-disk photons, yielding a lower electron temperature. In this case, the evolution of the height of the elevated region could explain the evolution of the electron temperature associated with the coherent variability throughout the hard state."}

The data clearly separate the relativistic broad line from the underlying continuum and from narrow emission and absorption features in the Fe band. The unprecedented spectral resolution in the Fe K band clearly demonstrates that the flux excess can be attributed to a single, broad feature, as opposed to a superposition of previously unresolved narrow features. This broad feature can be best interpreted as emission consistent with an origin near the innermost stable circular orbit around a rapidly rotating black hole. By modeling the shape of the broad line, we find a black hole spin of $a\\simeq0.98$ and an inclination of the inner accretion disk of $θ\\simeq63^\\circ$. The spin is consistent with prior reflection studies, reaffirming the robustness of past spin measurements using the relativistic reflection method. The measured inclination provides reinforcing evidence of a disk-orbit misalignment in Cygnus X-1. These results highlight the unique abilities of XRISM in separating overlapping spectral features and providing constraints on the geometry of accretion in X-ray binaries."}

It showcases the case of capturing Envisat, a large ESA satellite that remains in orbit as space debris following the end of its mission. This work investigates different mechanical models, which can be used to simulate the net dynamics, simulating various degrees of compliance, and different control strategies to achieve the capture of the debris, depending on the relative position of the net and the target. Unlike previous works on this topic, we do not assume that the net has been previously ballistically thrown toward the target, and we start from a relatively static configuration. The results show that a more compliant net achieves higher performance when attempting the capture of Envisat. Moreover, when paired with a sliding mode controller, soft nets are able to achieve successful capture in 100% of the tested cases, whilst also showcasing a higher effective area at contact and a higher number of contact points between net and Envisat."}

Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

The mapping module solves the problems of sparse depth data, free-space gaps, and large depth uncertainty by oversampling free space in texture-sparse areas and keeping track of obstacle position uncertainty. The planning module handles the added free-space uncertainty through rapid replanning and perception-aware heading control. We further show that frontier-based exploration is possible with sparse monocular depth data when parallax requirements and the possibility of textureless surfaces are taken into account. We evaluate our approach extensively in diverse real-world and simulated environments, including ablation studies.

This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information.

A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation."}

In this work, we introduce AMS (Agility Meets Stability), the first framework that unifies both dynamic motion tracking and extreme balance maintenance in a single policy. Our key insight is to leverage heterogeneous data sources: human motion capture datasets that provide rich, agile behaviors, and physically constrained synthetic balance motions that capture stability configurations. To reconcile the divergent optimization goals of agility and stability, we design a hybrid reward scheme that applies general tracking objectives across all data while injecting balance-specific priors only into synthetic motions. Further, an adaptive learning strategy with performance-driven sampling and motion-specific reward shaping enables efficient training across diverse motion distributions. We validate AMS extensively in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Experiments demonstrate that a single policy can execute agile skills such as dancing and running, while also performing zero-shot extreme balance motions like Ip Man's Squat, highlighting AMS as a versatile control paradigm for future humanoid applications."}

Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control."}

Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities.

To address the challenge, we present RoboCOIN, a comprehensive multi-embodiment bimanual manipulation dataset with over 180,000 demonstrations collected from 15 distinct robotic platforms. The dataset covers 16 scenarios, including residential, commercial, and working environments, with 421 tasks systematically organized by bimanual coordination patterns and object properties. Our key innovation is a hierarchical capability pyramid that provides multi-level annotations, spanning trajectory-level concepts, segment-level subtasks, and frame-level kinematics. We further develop CoRobot, a comprehensive processing framework featuring Robot Trajectory Markup Language (RTML) for quality assessment, automated annotation generation, and unified multi-embodiment management. Extensive experiments demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of RoboCOIN in multi-embodiment bimanual learning, with significant performance improvements across various model architectures and robotic platforms. The complete dataset and framework are open-sourced and publicly available for further research purposes. Project website: https://FlagOpen.github.io/RoboCOIN/."}

However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling."}

Our system, named HALO, addresses two key challenges: (i) real-time dense 3D reconstruction using vision at large distances, and (ii) mapping and exploration of large-scale outdoor environments with accurate scene geometry and semantics. We demonstrate that HALO can plan informative paths that exploit this information to complete missions with multiple tasks specified in natural language. In simulation-based evaluation across large-scale environments of size up to 78,000 sq. m., HALO consistently completes tasks with less exploration time and achieves up to 68% higher competitive ratio in terms of the distance traveled compared to the state-of-the-art semantic exploration baseline. We use real-world experiments on a custom quadrotor platform to demonstrate that (i) all modules can run onboard the robot, and that (ii) in diverse environments HALO can support effective autonomous execution of missions covering up to 24,600 sq. m. area at an altitude of 40 m.

The world model leverages action and visual inputs to predict future image states, learning the underlying physics of the environment to refine action generation. Conversely, the VLA model produces subsequent actions from image observations, enhancing visual understanding and supporting the world model's image generation. The unified framework of RynnVLA-002 enables joint learning of environmental dynamics and action planning. Our experiments show that RynnVLA-002 surpasses individual VLA and world models, demonstrating their mutual enhancement. We evaluate RynnVLA-002 in both simulation and real-world robot tasks. RynnVLA-002 achieves 97.4% success rate on the LIBERO simulation benchmark without pretraining, while in real-world LeRobot experiments, its integrated world model boosts the overall success rate by 50%."}
